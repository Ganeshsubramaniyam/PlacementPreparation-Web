John summarized the batting performance through three diagrams, one for each game. In each diagram, the three outer triangles communicate the number of runs scored by the three top scorers from India, where K, R, S, V, and Y represent Kaif, Rahul, Saurav, Virender, and Yuvraj respectively. The middle triangle in each diagram denotes the percentage of total score that was scored by the top three Indian scorers in that game. No two players score the same number of runs in the same game. John also calculated two batting indices for each player based on his scores in the tournament; the R-index of a batsman is the difference between his highest and lowest scores in the 3 games while the M-index is the middle number, if his scores are arranged in a non-increasing order.<BR><IMG alt=""Description: reasoning ability questions"" src=""file:///C:/Users/jos/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.jpg"" width=500 height=131></SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Goldman Sachs predicted that crude oil price would hit $200 and just as it appeared that alternativerenewable energy had a chance of becoming an economically viable option, the international price ofoil fell by over 70%. After hitting the all-time high of $147 a barrel, a month ago, crude oil fell to lessthan $40 a barrel. What explains this sharp decline in the international price of oil? There has not beenany major new discovery of a hitherto unknown source of oil or gas. The short answer is that thedemand does not have to fall by a very sizeable quantity for the price of crude to respond as it did. In</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">the short run, the price elasticity of demand for crude oil is very low. Conversely, in the short run, evena relatively big change in the price of oil does not immediately lower consumption. It takes months, oryears, of high oil price to inculcate habits of energy conservation. World crude oil price had remainedat over $60 a barrel for most of 2005-2007 without making any major dent in demand.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">The long answer is more complex. The economic slowdown in the US, Europe and Asia along withdollar depreciation and commodity speculation have all had some role in the downward descent in theinternational price of oil. In recent years, the supply of oil has been rising but not enough to catch upwith the rising demand, resulting in an almost vertical escalation in its price. The number of crude oilfutures and options contracts have also increased manifold which has led to significant speculation inthe oil market. In comparison, the role of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">in fixing crude price has considerably weakened. OPEC is often accused of operating as a cartelrestricting output thus keeping prices artificially high. It did succeed in setting the price of crude duringthe 1970s and the first half of the 80s. But, with increased futures trading and contracts, the control ofcrude pricing has moved from OPEC to banks and markets that deal with futures trading and contracts.It is true that most oil exporting regions of the world have remained politically unstable fuelling speculation over the price of crude. But there is little evidence that the geopolitical uncertainties in westAsia have improved to weaken the price of oil. Threatened by the downward slide of oil price, OPEChas, in fact, announced its decision to curtail output.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">However most oil importers will heave a sigh of relief as they find their oil import bills decline except for those who bought options to import oil at prices higher than market prices. Exporting nations, on the other hand, will see their economic prosperity slip. Relatively low price of crude is also bad newsfor investments in alternative renewable energy that cannot compete with cheaper and non-renewable</SPAN></SPAN></P>
