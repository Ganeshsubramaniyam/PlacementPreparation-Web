<P><BR><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>Tell me about yourself: -&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>The most often asked question in interviews. You need to have a short statement prepared in your mind. Be careful that it does not sound rehearsed. Limit it to work-related items unless instructed otherwise. Talk about things you have done and jobs you have held that relate to the position you are interviewing for. Start with the item farthest back and work up to the present.<BR><BR><B>What experience do you have in this field? -&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>Speak about specifics that relate to the position you are applying for. If you do not have specific experience, get as close as you can.<BR><BR><B>Do you consider yourself successful?</B><BR><BR>You should always answer yes and briefly explain why. A good explanation is that you have set goals, and you have met some and are on track to achieve the others.<BR><BR><B>What do co-workers say about you?</B><BR><BR>Be prepared with a quote or two from co-workers. Either a specific statement or a paraphrase will work. Jill Clark, a co-worker at Smith Company, always said I was the hardest workers she had ever known. It is as powerful as Jill having said it at the interview herself.<BR><BR><B>What do you know about this organization?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>This question is one reason to do some research on the organization before the interview. Find out where they have been and where they are going. What are the current issues and who are the major players?<BR><BR><B>What have you done to improve your knowledge in the last year?</B><BR><BR>Try to include improvement activities that relate to the job. A wide variety of activities can be mentioned as positive self-improvement. Have some good ones handy to mention.<BR>Are you applying for other jobs? - Be honest but do not spend a lot of time in this area. Keep the focus on this job and what you can do for this organization. Anything else is a distraction.<BR><BR><B>Why do you want to work for this organization?</B><BR><BR>This may take some thought and certainly, should be based on the research you have done on the organization. Sincerity is extremely important here and will easily be sensed. Relate it to your long-term career goals.<BR><BR><B>Do you know anyone who works for us?</B><BR><BR>Be aware of the policy on relatives working for the organization. This can affect your answer even though they asked about friends not relatives. Be careful to mention a friend only if they are well thought of.<BR><BR><B>What kind of salary do you need?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>A loaded question. A nasty little game that you will probably lose if you answer first. So, do not answer it. Instead, say something like, That’s a tough question. Can you tell me the range for this position? In most cases, the interviewer, taken off guard, will tell you. If not, say that it can depend on the details of the job. Then give a wide range.<BR><BR><B>Are you a team player?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>You are, of course, a team player. Be sure to have examples ready. Specifics that show you often perform for the good of the team rather than for yourself are good evidence of your team attitude. Do not brag, just say it in a matter-of-fact tone. This is a key point.<BR><BR><B>How long would you expect to work for us if hired?</B><BR><BR>Specifics here are not good. Something like this should work: I’d like it to be a long time. Or As long as we both feel I’m doing a good job.<BR><BR><B>Have you ever had to fire anyone? How did you feel about that?</B><BR><BR>This is serious. Do not make light of it or in any way seem like you like to fire people. At the same time, you will do it when it is the right thing to do. When it comes to the organization versus the individual who has created a harmful situation, you will protect the organization. Remember firing is not the same as layoff or reduction in force.<BR><BR><B>What is your philosophy towards work?</B><BR><BR>The interviewer is not looking for a long or flowery dissertation here. Do you have strong feelings that the job gets done? Yes. That’s the type of answer that works best here. Short and positive, showing a benefit to the organization.<BR><BR><B>If you had enough money to retire right now, would you?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>Answer yes if you would. But since you need to work, this is the type of work you prefer. Do not say yes if you do not mean it.<BR>Have you ever been asked to leave a position? - If you have not, say no. If you have, be honest, brief and avoid saying negative things about the people or organization involved.<BR><BR><B>Explain how you would be an asset to this organization?</B><BR><BR>You should be anxious for this question. It gives you a chance to highlight your best points as they relate to the position being discussed. Give a little advance thought to this relationship.<BR><BR><B>Why should we hire you?</B><BR><BR>Point out how your assets meet what the organization needs. Do not mention any other candidates to make a comparison.<BR>Tell me about a suggestion you have made - Have a good one ready. Be sure and use a suggestion that was accepted and was then considered successful. One related to the type of work applied for is a real plus.<BR><BR><B>What is your greatest strength?</B><BR><BR>Numerous answers are good, just stay positive. A few good examples: Your ability to prioritize, Your problem-solving skills, Your ability to work under pressure, Your ability to focus on projects, Your professional expertise, Your leadership skills, Your positive attitude .<BR><BR><B>Tell me about your dream job.?</B><BR><BR>Stay away from a specific job. You cannot win. If you say the job you are contending for is it, you strain credibility. If you say another job is it, you plant the suspicion that you will be dissatisfied with this position if hired. The best is to stay genetic and say something like: A job where I love the work, like the people, can contribute and can’t wait to get to work.</SPAN></SPAN></P>"	<B>Aricent</B> Interview-HR Interview	21	4	4/2/2013	0

The GD is to check how you behave, participate and contibute in a group, how much importance do you give to the group objective as well as your own, how well do you listen to viewpoints of others and how open-minded are you in accepting views contrary to your own. The aspects which make up a GD are verbal communication, non-verbal behaviour, conformation to norms, decision-making ability and cooperation.

<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>This year Aricent visited our campus students were allowed cur oof aggregate was 65%. ECE, TCE, CSE, ISE, EEE, MTech, MCA branches Jobs positions offered software engineer, development or testing will be decided later. Package was 3.5lpa.from TCE branch. A short descriptions of aricent campus placement procedure<BR><BR>Aricent was section aptitude on line test&nbsp;<BR>Verbal ability, aptitude, reasoning and technical questions&nbsp;<BR><BR>Verbal is just basic English. Just going through any competitive exam book for verbal should be enough, 25 questions with 25 minutes were given for this. Quant is quite easy too. A few questions might trip you, but never mind, if you can get most of them right its sufficient. Here 35 minutes is provided for 25 questions. Programming questions are almost in pseudocode only.<BR><BR>Knowing basics of C, C++ and data structures should be more than enough. Here again 25 minutes for 35 questions. Logical is also simple. Here 24 questions with 25 minutes is provided.<BR><BR>Sectional cut-off is present so try to perform well in all sections.<BR><BR>Aricent second section&nbsp;<BR><BR>Once aptitude is cleared, a critical incident form is given to be filled. It has few questions as about yourself, your approach towards the job and few other questions regarding your life experiences as in what you did when you were put up in some sort of a situation.<BR><BR>Aricent third section Group discussion GD<BR><BR>Next round is group discussion. Do not panic, this is a non elimination round.<BR>Topic will either be given to you or you will only be asked to choose a topic. Dont overpower others and you dont have to speak too much either. It'll be in a group of ten and half an hour is alloted for the group. If u can fit in 3-4 points in between you should be fine.<BR><BR>**Do not ignore it as it is non-elimination. The scores of gd will be included along with the next rounds for elimination.<BR><BR>Aricent technical round<BR><BR>Next comes technical round. This is an interview round. As am from telecommunication branch, I can give info about this for ECE, TCE and EEE branches. Even though we are from electronics background they expect us to know the basics of C,C++ and data structures. Some will be confused as to how much is basics. For C till structures and unions should be enough, C++ till classes and inheritance, and data structures only linked lists, queue, stacks and trees should be good.<BR><BR>Do know the 3 basic sorting algorithms, ie, bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort. And be thorough with the basics of core subjects, mainly analog electronics, logic design, microcontroller, microprocessors, communication subjects (analog and digital) and communication networks too. If you had opted for OS, know that well too. And if you dont know anything just say it.<BR><BR>If you are asked about a subject you've never studied at all, say it directly but in a polite way, instead of giving wrong answers. And yes they will ask you to write basic programs. From this round onwards luck also matters, as to who will take your interview. The interviewer may be easy, moderate or tough.<BR><BR>I had a moderate one. :) Here many get eliminated and the elimination is based on a combination of gd and technical scores.<BR><BR>** For other branches such as CS, IS, MCA etc, know your programming well and be strong with the basics of your core subjects. I dont know much about what they ask candidates from these branches.<BR><BR>Next is the HR round. Once you reach till here, you are 95% placed. This round is one of the simplest and dangerous one. I liked it. Do you homework and know a few things on how to behave in an HR interview. Until you behave normally and not like a psychopath you will get through. None of the questions will be based on anything you study or any puzzles. Just normal interaction to check your personality. Remain calm and answer sensibly in a polite manner.<BR><BR>They announced the results in less than hour or so for us as it was campus recruitment's. No idea about off campus. I was delighted when my name was called in the list of placed candidates.<BR><BR>Keep yourself refreshed all day, because my HR round actually happened at 09:30 pm and results were announced at 10:30 pm. It will be a long day.<BR><BR>As for statistics, nearly 400 students had applied. Aricent recruited with a girls:boys ratio of 4:1. They can change this ratio anytime.<BR><BR>Out of 400, 90 cleared aptitude.<BR><BR>After technical only 49 were left.<BR><BR>After HR 35 got selected. 25 girls and 8 guys. Lucky to be one of the 8 guys.&nbsp;<BR><BR>93 students were short listed from around 400 students.</FONT></P>"	<B>Aricent</B> Question-Paper	21	4	6/22/2014	0

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>Aricent 100 technical questions with answers</B></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>1. What does static variable mean?<BR>Ans: Static variables are the variables which retain their values between the function calls. They are initialized only once their scope is within the function in which they are defined.</B><BR><BR>2. What is a pointer?<BR>Ans: Pointers are variables which stores the address of another variable. That variable may be a scalar (including another pointer), or an aggregate (array or structure). The pointed-to object may be part of a larger object, such as a field of a structure or an element in an array.&nbsp;<BR><BR>3. What are the uses of a pointer?<BR>Ans: Pointer is used in the following cases<BR>i) It is used to access array elements<BR>ii) It is used for dynamic memory allocation.<BR>iii) It is used in Call by reference<BR>iv) It is used in data structures like trees, graph, linked list etc.&nbsp;<BR><BR>4. What is a structure?<BR>Ans: Structure constitutes a super data type which represents several different data types in a single unit. A structure can be initialized if it is static or global.&nbsp;<BR><BR>5. What is a union?<BR>Ans: Union is a collection of heterogeneous data type but it uses efficient memory utilization technique by allocating enough memory to hold the largest member. Here a single area of memory contains values of different types at different time. A union can never be initialized.&nbsp;<BR><BR>6. What are the differences between structures and union?<BR>Ans: A structure variable contains each of the named members, and its size is large enough to hold all the members. Structure elements are of same size. A union contains one of the named members at a given time and is large enough to hold the largest member. Union element can be of different sizes.&nbsp;<BR><BR>7. What are the differences between structures and arrays?<BR>Ans: Structure is a collection of heterogeneous data type but array is a collection of homogeneous data types.&nbsp;<BR>Array&nbsp;<BR>1-It is a collection of data items of same data type.<BR>2-It has declaration only<BR>3-.There is no keyword.<BR>4- array name represent the address of the starting element.&nbsp;<BR>Structure<BR>1-It is a collection of data items of different data type.<BR>2- It has declaration and definition<BR>3- keyword struct is used<BR>4-Structure name is known as tag it is the short hand notation of the declaration.&nbsp;<BR><BR>8. In header files whether functions are declared or defined?<BR>Ans: Functions are declared within header file. That is function prototypes exist in a header file,not function bodies. They are defined in library (lib).&nbsp;<BR><BR>9. What are the differences between malloc () and calloc ()?<BR>Ans: Malloc Calloc 1-Malloc takes one argument Malloc(a);where a number of bytes 2-memory allocated contains garbage values&nbsp;<BR>1-Calloc takes two arguments Calloc(b,c) where b no of object and c size of object<BR>2-It initializes the contains of block of memory to zerosMalloc takes one argument, memory allocated contains garbage values.&nbsp;<BR>It allocates contiguous memory locations. Calloc takes two arguments, memory allocated contains all zeros, and the memory allocated is not contiguous.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>10. What are macros? What are its advantages and disadvantages?<BR>Ans: Macros are abbreviations for lengthy and frequently used statements. When a macro is called the entire code is substituted by a single line though the macro definition is of several lines. The advantage of macro is that it reduces the time taken for control transfer as in case of function. The disadvantage of it is here the entire code is substituted so the program becomes lengthy if a macro is called several times.&nbsp;<BR><BR>11. Difference between pass by reference and pass by value?<BR>Ans: Pass by reference passes a pointer to the value. This allows the callee to modify the variable directly.Pass by value gives a copy of the value to the callee. This allows the callee tomodify the value without modifying the variable. (In other words, the callee simply cannot modify the variable, since it lacks a reference to it.)<BR><BR>12. What is static identifier?<BR>Ans: A file-scope variable that is declared static is visible only to functions within that file. A function-scope or block-scope variable that is declared as static is visible only within that scope. Furthermore, static variables only have a single instance. In the case of function- or block-scope variables, this means that the variable is not ?automatic and thus retains its value across function invocations.&nbsp;<BR><BR>13. Where is the auto variables stored?<BR>Ans: Auto variables can be stored anywhere, so long as recursion works. Practically, they‘re stored on the stack. It is not necessary that always a stack exist. You could theoretically allocate function invocation records from the heap.&nbsp;<BR><BR>14. Where does global, static, and local, register variables, free memory and C Program instructions get stored?<BR>Ans: Global: Wherever the linker puts them. Typically the ?BSS segment on many platforms.Static: Again, wherever the linker puts them. Often, they‘re intermixed with the globals. Theonly difference between globals and statics is whether the linker will resolve the symbols across compilation units.Local: Typically on the stack, unless the variable gets register allocated and never spills.Register: Nowadays, these are equivalent to ?Local variables. They live on the stackunless they get register-allocated.&nbsp;<BR><BR>15. Difference between arrays and linked list?<BR>Ans: An array is a repeated pattern of variables in contiguous storage. A linked list is a set of structures scattered through memory, held together by pointers in each element that point to the next element. With an array, we can (on most architectures) move from one element to the nextby adding a fixed constant to the integer value of the pointer. With a linked list, there is a ?next<BR>pointer in each structure which says what element comes next.&nbsp;<BR>16. What are enumerations?<BR>Ans: They are a list of named integer-valued constants. Example:enum color { black , orange=4, yellow, green, blue, violet };This declaration defines the symbols ?black ?orange ?yellow etc. to have the values ?1,?4,?5,… etc. The difference between an enumeration and a macro is that the enum actually declares a type, and therefore can be type checked.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>17. Describe about storage allocation and scope of global, extern, static, local and register variables?<BR>Ans:<BR>Globals have application-scope. They‘re available in any compilation unit that includes an appropriate declaration (usually brought from a header file). They‘re stored wherever the linker puts them, usually a place called the ?BSS segment Extern?&nbsp;<BR>This is essentially ?global.Static: Stored the same place as globals, typically, but only available to the compilation unit that contains them. If they are block-scope global, only available within that block and its subblocks.<BR>Local: Stored on the stack, typically. Only available in that block and its subblocks. (Although pointers to locals can be passed to functions invoked from within a scope where that local is valid.)<BR>Register: See tirade above on ?local vs. ?register.The only difference is that the C compiler will not let you take the address of something you‘ve declared as ?register&nbsp;<BR><BR>18. What are register variables? What are the advantages of using register variables?<BR>Ans: If a variable is declared with a register storage class,it is known as register variable.The register variable is stored in the cpu register instead of main memory.Frequently used variables are declared as register variable as it‘s access time is faster.&nbsp;<BR><BR>19. What is the use of typedef?<BR>Ans: The typedef help in easier modification when the programs are ported to another machine. A descriptive new name given to the existing data type may be easier to understand the code.&nbsp;<BR><BR>20. Can we specify variable field width in a scanf() format string? If possible how?<BR>Ans: All field widths are variable with scanf(). You can specify a maximum field width for a given field by placing an integer value between the ?%‘ and the field type specifier. (e.g. %64s). Such aspecifier will still accept a narrower field width. The one exception is %#c (where # is an integer). This reads EXACTLY # characters, and it is the only way to specify a fixed field width with scanf().&nbsp;<BR><BR>21. Out of fgets() and gets() which function is safe to use and why?<BR>Ans: fgets() is safer than gets(), because we can specify a maximum input length. Neither one is completely safe, because the compiler can‘t prove that programmer won‘t overflow the buffer he pass to fgets ().<BR><BR>22. Difference between strdup and strcpy?<BR>Ans: Both copy a string. strcpy wants a buffer to copy into. strdup allocates a buffer using malloc(). Unlike strcpy(), strdup() is not specified by ANSI .&nbsp;<BR><BR>23. What is recursion?<BR>Ans: A recursion function is one which calls itself either directly or indirectly it must halt at a definite point to avoid infinite recursion.&nbsp;<BR><BR>24. Differentiate between for loop and a while loop? What are it uses?<BR>Ans: For executing a set of statements fixed number of times we use for loop while when the number of iterations to be performed is not known in advance we use while loop.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>25. What is storage class? What are the different storage classes in C?<BR>Ans: Storage class is an attribute that changes the behavior of a variable. It controls the lifetime, scope and linkage. The storage classes in c are auto, register, and extern, static, typedef.&nbsp;<BR><BR>26. What the advantages of using Unions?<BR>Ans: When the C compiler is allocating memory for unions it will always reserve enough room for the largest member.&nbsp;<BR><BR>27. What is the difference between Strings and Arrays?<BR>Ans: String is a sequence of characters ending with NULL .it can be treated as a one dimensional array of characters terminated by a NULL character.&nbsp;<BR><BR>28. What is a far pointer? Where we use it?<BR>Ans: In large data model (compact, large, huge) the address B0008000 is acceptable because in these model all pointers to data are 32bits long. If we use small data model(tiny, small, medium) the<BR>above address won‘t work since in these model each pointer is 16bits long. If we are working in a small data model and want to access the address B0008000 then we use far pointer. Far pointer is always treated as a 32bit pointer and contains a segment address and offset address both of 16bits each. Thus the address is represented using segment : offset format B000h:8000h. For any given memory address there are many possible far address segment : offset pair. The segment register contains the address where the segment begins and offset register contains the offset of data/code from where segment begins.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>29. What is a huge pointer?<BR>Ans: Huge pointer is 32bit long containing segment address and offset address. Huge pointers are normalized pointers so for any given memory address there is only one possible huge address segment: offset pair. Huge pointer arithmetic is doe with calls to special subroutines so its arithmetic slower than any other pointers.&nbsp;<BR><BR>30. What is a normalized pointer, how do we normalize a pointer?<BR>Ans: It is a 32bit pointer, which has as much of its value in the segment register as possible.Since a segment can start every 16bytes so the offset will have a value from 0 to F. for normalization convert the address into 20bit address then use the 16bit for segment address and 4bit for the offset address. Given a pointer 500D: 9407,we convert it to a 20bitabsolute address549D7,Which then normalized to 549D:0007.&nbsp;<BR><BR>31. What is near pointer?<BR>Ans: A near pointer is 16 bits long. It uses the current content of the CS (code segment) register(if the pointer is pointing to code) or current contents of DS (data segment) register (if the pointer is pointing to data) for the segment part, the offset part is stored in a 16 bit near pointer. Using near pointer limits the data/code to 64kb segment.<BR><BR>32. In C, why is the void pointer useful? When would you use it?<BR>Ans: The void pointer is useful because it is a generic pointer that any pointer can be cast into and back again without loss of information.&nbsp;<BR><BR>33. What is a NULL Pointer? Whether it is same as an uninitialized pointer?<BR>Ans: Null pointer is a pointer which points to nothing but uninitialized pointer may point to anywhere.&nbsp;<BR><BR>34. Are pointers integer?<BR>Ans: No, pointers are not integers. A pointer is an address. It is a positive number.&nbsp;<BR><BR>35. What does the error ‘Null Pointer Assignment’ means and what causes this error?<BR>Ans: As null pointer points to nothing so accessing a uninitialized pointer or invalid location may cause an error.&nbsp;<BR><BR>36. What is generic pointer in C?<BR>Ans: In C void* acts as a generic pointer. When other pointer types are assigned to generic pointer, conversions are applied automatically (implicit conversion).&nbsp;<BR><BR>37. Are the expressions arr and &amp;arr same for an array of integers?<BR>Ans: Yes for array of integers they are same.&nbsp;<BR><BR>38. IMP&gt;How pointer variables are initialized?<BR>Ans: Pointer variables are initialized by one of the following ways.<BR>I. Static memory allocation<BR>II. Dynamic memory allocation&nbsp;<BR><BR>39. What is static memory allocation?<BR>Ans: Compiler allocates memory space for a declared variable. By using the address of operator, the reserved address is obtained and this address is assigned to a pointer variable. This way of assigning pointer value to a pointer variable at compilation time is known as static memory allocation.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>40. What is dynamic memory allocation?<BR>Ans: A dynamic memory allocation uses functions such as malloc() or calloc() to get memory dynamically. If these functions are used to get memory dynamically and the values returned by these function are assigned to pointer variables, such a way of allocating memory at run time is known as dynamic memory allocation.&nbsp;<BR><BR>41. What is the purpose of realloc?&nbsp;<BR>Ans: It increases or decreases the size of dynamically allocated array. The function realloc (ptr,n) uses two arguments. The first argument ptr is a pointer to a block of memory for which the size is to be altered. The second argument specifies the new size. The size may be increased or decreased. If sufficient space is not available to the old region the function may create a new region.<BR><BR>42. What is pointer to a pointer?<BR>Ans: If a pointer variable points another pointer value. Such a situation is known as a pointer to a pointer.<BR>Example:<BR>int *p1,**p2,v=10;<BR>P1=&amp;v; p2=&amp;p1;<BR>Here p2 is a pointer to a pointer.&nbsp;<BR><BR>43. What is an array of pointers?<BR>Ans: if the elements of an array are addresses, such an array is called an array of pointers.&nbsp;<BR><BR>44. Difference between linker and linkage?<BR>Ans: Linker converts an object code into an executable code by linking together the necessary built in functions. The form and place of declaration where the variable is declared in a program determine the linkage of variable.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>45. Is it possible to have negative index in an array?<BR>Ans: Yes it is possible to index with negative value provided there are data stored in this location. Even if it is illegal to refer to the elements that are out of array bounds, the compiler will not produce error because C has no check on the bounds of an array.<BR><BR>46. Why is it necessary to give the size of an array in an array declaration?<BR>Ans: When an array is declared, the compiler allocates a base address and reserves enough space in memory for all the elements of the array. The size is required to allocate the required space and hence size must be mentioned.&nbsp;<BR><BR>47. What modular programming?<BR>Ans: If a program is large, it is subdivided into a number of smaller programs that are called modules or subprograms. If a complex problem is solved using more modules, this approach is known as modular programming.&nbsp;<BR><BR>48. What is a function?<BR>Ans: A large program is subdivided into a number of smaller programs or subprograms. Each subprogram specifies one or more actions to be performed for the larger program. Such sub programs are called functions.&nbsp;<BR><BR>49. What is an argument?<BR>Ans: An argument is an entity used to pass data from the calling to a called function.&nbsp;<BR><BR>50. What are built in functions?<BR>Ans: The functions that are predefined and supplied along with the compiler are known as builtin functions.Theyarealsoknown aslibrary functions.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>51. Difference between formal argument and actual argument?<BR>Ans: Formal arguments are the arguments available in the function definition. They are preceded by their own data type. Actual arguments are available in the function call. These arguments are given as constants or variables or expressions to pass the values to the function.<BR><BR>52. Is it possible to have more than one main() function in a C program ?<BR>Ans: The function main() can appear only once. The program execution starts from main.&nbsp;<BR><BR>53. What is the difference between an enumeration and a set of pre-processor # defines?<BR>Ans: There is hardly any difference between the two, except that #defines has a global effect(throughout the file) whereas an enumeration can have an effect local to the block if desired.Some advantages of enumeration are that the numeric values are automatically assigned whereasin #define we have to explicitly define them. A disadvantage is that we have no control over the size of enumeration variables.&nbsp;<BR><BR>54. How are Structure passing and returning implemented by the complier?<BR>Ans: When structures are passed as argument to functions, the entire structure is typically pushed on the stack. To avoid this overhead many programmer often prefer to pass pointers to structure instead of actual structures. Structures are often returned from functions in a location pointed to by an extra, compiler-supported ?hidden‘ argument to the function.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>55. IMP&gt;what is the similarity between a Structure, Union and enumeration?<BR>Ans: All of them let the programmer to define new data type.&nbsp;<BR><BR>56. Can a Structure contain a Pointer to itself?<BR>Ans: Yes such structures are called self-referential structures.&nbsp;<BR><BR>57. How can we read/write Structures from/to data files?<BR>Ans: To write out a structure we can use fwrite() as Fwrite( &amp;e, sizeof(e),1,fp);Where e is a structure variable. A corresponding fread() invocation can read the structure back from file. calling fwrite() it writes out sizeof(e) bytes from the address &amp;e. Data files written as memory images with fwrite(),however ,will not be portable, particularly if they contain floating point fields or Pointers. This is because memory layout of structures is machine and compiler dependent. Therefore, structures written as memory images cannot necessarily be read back by programs running on other machine, and this is the important concern if the data files you‘re writing will ever be interchanged between machines.&nbsp;<BR><BR>58. Write a program which employs Recursion?<BR>Ans: int fact(int n) { return n &gt; 1 ? n * fact(n – 1) : 1; }&nbsp;<BR><BR>59.Write a program which uses Command Line Arguments?<BR>Ans:&nbsp;<BR>#include<BR>void main(int argc,char *argv[])<BR>{<BR>int i;<BR>clrscr();<BR>for(i=0;i<BR>printf(?\n%d?,argv[i]);<BR>}&nbsp;<BR><BR>60. Difference between array and pointer?<BR>Ans: array&nbsp;<BR>1- Array allocates space automatically<BR>2- It cannot be resized<BR>3- It cannot be reassigned<BR>4- sizeof (arrayname) gives the number of bytes occupied by the array.&nbsp;<BR>Pointer<BR>1-Explicitly assigned to point to an allocated space.<BR>2-It can be sized using realloc()<BR>3-pointer can be reassigned.<BR>4-sizeof (p) returns the number of bytes used to store the pointer variable p.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>61. What do the ‘c’ and ‘v’ in argc and argv stand for?<BR>Ans: The c in argc(argument count) stands for the number of command line argument the program is invoked with and v in argv(argument vector) is a pointer to an array of character string that contain the arguments.<BR><BR>62. IMP&gt;what are C tokens?<BR>Ans: There are six classes of tokens: identifier, keywords, constants, string literals, operators and other separators.&nbsp;<BR><BR>63. What are C identifiers?<BR>Ans: These are names given to various programming element such as variables, function, arrays.It is a combination of letter, digit and underscore.It should begin with letter. Backspace is not allowed.&nbsp;<BR><BR>64. Difference between syntax vs logical error?<BR>Ans:<BR>Syntax Error&nbsp;<BR>1-These involves validation of syntax of language.<BR>2-compiler prints diagnostic message.&nbsp;<BR>Logical Error<BR>1-logical error are caused by an incorrect algorithm or by a statement mistyped in such a way<BR>that it doesn‘t violet syntax of language.<BR>2-difficult to find.&nbsp;<BR><BR>65. What is preincrement and post increment?<BR>Ans: ++n (pre increment) increments n before its value is used in an assignment operation or any expression containing it. n++ (post increment) does increment after the value of n is used.&nbsp;<BR><BR>66. Write a program to interchange 2 variables without using the third one.<BR>Ans:<BR>a ^= b; ie a=a^b<BR>b ^= a; ie b=b^a;<BR>a ^= b ie a=a^b;<BR>here the numbers are converted into binary and then xor operation is performed.<BR>You know, you‘re just asking ?have you seen this overly clever trick that‘s not worth applying on modern architectures and only really applies to integer variables?<BR><BR>67. What is the maximum combined length of command line arguments including the space between adjacent arguments?<BR>Ans: It depends on the operating system.&nbsp;<BR><BR>68. What are bit fields? What is the use of bit fields in a Structure declaration?<BR>Ans: A bit field is a set of adjacent bits within a single implementation based storage unit that we will call a ?word The syntax of field definition and access is based on structure. Struct { unsigned int k :1;<BR>unsigned int l :1;unsigned int m :1;}flags;the number following the colon represents the field width in bits.Flag is a variable that containsthree bit fields.&nbsp;<BR><BR>69. What is a preprocessor, what are the advantages of preprocessor?<BR>Ans: A preprocessor processes the source code program before it passes through the compiler.&nbsp;<BR>1- a preprocessor involves the readability of program<BR>2- It facilitates easier modification<BR>3- It helps in writing portable programs<BR>4- It enables easier debugging<BR>5- It enables testing a part of program<BR>6- It helps in developing generalized program&nbsp;<BR><BR>70. What are the facilities provided by preprocessor?<BR>Ans:<BR>1-file inclusion<BR>2-substitution facility<BR>3-conditional compilation&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>71. What are the two forms of #include directive?<BR>Ans:<BR>1.#include?filename?<BR>2.#include the first form is used to search the directory that contains the source file.If the search fails in the home directory it searches the implementation defined locations.In the second form ,the<BR>preprocessor searches the file only in the implementation defined locations.<BR><BR>72. How would you use the functions randomize() and random()?<BR>Ans:<BR>Randomize() initiates random number generation with a random value.<BR>Random() generates random number between 0 and n-1;&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>73. What do the functions atoi(), itoa() and gcvt() do?<BR>Ans: atoi() is a macro that converts integer to character.<BR>itoa() It converts an integer to string<BR>gcvt() It converts a floating point number to string&nbsp;<BR><BR>74. How would you use the functions fseek(), freed(), fwrite() and ftell()?<BR>Ans:fseek(f,1,i) Move the pointer for file f a distance 1 byte from location i. fread(s,i1,i2,f) Enter i2 dataitems,each of size i1 bytes,from file f to string s.fwrite(s,i1,i2,f) send i2 data items,each of size i1 bytes from string s to file f.<BR>ftell(f) Return the current pointer position within file f. The data type returned for functions fread,fseek and fwrite is int and ftell is long int.&nbsp;<BR><BR>75. What is the difference between the functions memmove() and memcpy()?<BR>Ans: The arguments of memmove() can overlap in memory. The arguments of memcpy()cannot.&nbsp;<BR><BR>76. What is a file?<BR>Ans: A file is a region of storage in hard disks or in auxiliary storage devices.It contains bytes of information .It is not a data type.&nbsp;<BR><BR>77. IMP&gt;what are the types of file?<BR>Ans: Files are of two types<BR>1-high level files (stream oriented files) :These files are accessed using library functions<BR>2-low level files(system oriented files) :These files are accessed using system calls&nbsp;<BR><BR>78. IMP&gt;what is a stream?<BR>Ans: A stream is a source of data or destination of data that may be associated with a disk or other I/O device. The source stream provides data to a program and it is known as input stream. The destination stream eceives the output from the program and is known as output stream.&nbsp;<BR><BR>79. What is meant by file opening?<BR>Ans: The action of connecting a program to a file is called opening of a file. This requires creating an I/O stream before reading or writing the data.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>80. What is FILE?<BR>Ans: FILE is a predefined data type. It is defined in stdio.h file.&nbsp;<BR><BR>81. What is a file pointer?<BR>Ans: The pointer to a FILE data type is called as a stream pointer or a file pointer. A file pointer points to the block of information of the stream that had just been opened.&nbsp;<BR><BR>82. How is fopen()used ?&nbsp;<BR><BR>83How is a file closed ?<BR>Ans: A file is closed using fclose() function Egfclose(fp); Where fp is a file pointer.&nbsp;<BR><BR>84. What is a random access file?<BR>Ans: File can be accessed at random using fseek() function fseek(fp,position,origin); fp file pointer position number of bytes offset from origin origin 0,1 or 2 denote the beginning ,current position or end of file respectively.&nbsp;<BR><BR>85. What is the purpose of ftell ?<BR>Ans: The function ftell() is used to get the current file represented by the file pointer. ftell(fp); returns a long integer value representing the current file position of the file pointed by the file pointer fp.If an error occurs ,-1 is returned.&nbsp;<BR><BR>86. What is the purpose of rewind() ?<BR>Ans: The function rewind is used to bring the file pointer to the beginning of the file.Rewind(fp);Where fp is a file pointer.Also we can get the same effect byfeek(fp,0,0);&nbsp;<BR><BR>87. Difference between a array name and a pointer variable?<BR>Ans: A pointer variable is a variable where as an array name is a fixed address and is not a variable. A pointer variable must be initialized but an array name cannot be initialized. An array name being&nbsp;<BR>a constant value , ++ and — operators cannot be applied to it.&nbsp;<BR><BR>88. Represent a two-dimensional array using pointer?<BR><BR>89. Difference between an array of pointers and a pointer to an array?<BR>Ans:<BR>Array of pointers&nbsp;<BR>1- Declaration is: data_type *array_name[size];<BR>2-Size represents the row size.<BR>3- The space for columns may be dynamically&nbsp;<BR>Pointers to an array<BR>1-Declaration is data_type ( *array_name)[size];<BR>2-Size represents the column size.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>90. Can we use any name in place of argv and argc as command line arguments ?<BR>Ans: yes we can use any user defined name in place of argc and argv;&nbsp;<BR><BR>91. What are the pointer declarations used in C?<BR>Ans:<BR>1- Array of pointers, e.g , int *a[10]; Array of pointers to integer<BR>2-Pointers to an array,e.g , int (*a)[10]; Pointer to an array of into<BR>3-Function returning a pointer,e.g, float *f( ) ; Function returning a pointer to float<BR>4-Pointer to a pointer ,e.g, int **x; Pointer to apointer to int<BR>5-pointer to a data type ,e.g, char *p; pointer to char<BR><BR>92. Differentiate between a constant pointer and pointer to a constant?<BR>Ans:<BR>const char *p; //pointer to a const character.<BR>char const *p; //pointer to a const character.<BR>char * const p; //const pointer to a char variable.<BR>const char * const p; // const pointer to a const character.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>93. Is the allocated space within a function automatically deallocated when the function returns?<BR>Ans: No pointer is different from what it points to .Local variables including local pointers variables in a function are deallocated automatically when function returns.,But in case of a local pointer variable ,deallocation means that the pointer is deallocated and not the block of memory allocated to it. Memory dynamically allocated always persists until the allocation is freed or the program terminates.&nbsp;<BR><BR>94. Discuss on pointer arithmetic?<BR>Ans:<BR>1- Assignment of pointers to the same type of pointers.<BR>2- Adding or subtracting a pointer and an integer.<BR>3-subtracting or comparing two pointer.<BR>4-incrementing or decrementing the pointers pointing to the elements of an array. When a pointer to an integer is incremented by one , the address is incremented by two. It is done automatically by the compiler.<BR>5-Assigning the value 0 to the pointer variable and comparing 0 with the pointer. The pointer having address 0 points to nowhere at all.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>95. What is the invalid pointer arithmetic?<BR>Ans:<BR>i) adding ,multiplying and dividing two pointers.<BR>ii) Shifting or masking pointer.<BR>iii) Addition of float or double to pointer.<BR>iv) Assignment of a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type&nbsp;<BR><BR>96. What are the advantages of using array of pointers to string instead of an array of strings?<BR>Ans:<BR>i) Efficient use of memory.<BR>ii) Easier to exchange the strings by moving their pointers while sorting.&nbsp;<BR>97. Are the expressions *ptr ++ and ++ *ptr same?<BR>Ans: No,*ptr ++ increments pointer and not the value pointed by it. Whereas ++ *ptr increments the value being pointed to by ptr.&nbsp;<BR><BR>98. What would be the equivalent pointer expression foe referring the same element as<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>99. Are the variables argc and argv are always local to main?<BR>Ans: Yes they are local to main.&nbsp;<BR><BR>100. Can main () be called recursively?<BR>Ans: Yes any function including main () can be called recursively.&nbsp;<BR><BR>101. IMP&gt;Can we initialize unions?<BR><BR>102. What’s the difference between these two declarations?<BR><BR>103. Why doesn’t this code: a[i] = i++; work?<BR>Ans: The subexpression i++ causes a side effect.it modifies i‘s value.which leads to undefined behavior since i is also referenced elsewhere in the s"	<B>Aricent</B> Whole-Testpaper	21	4	4/23/2014	0

Question was like 2-3 algorithms presented there and you have to identify the exact algorithm for eg. Which is the correct algorithm for Inorder traversal tree?

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Kelsey could not begin to fathom what she was hearing. In fact, a partof her began to feel she was in some sort of dream, unable to emerge to wakefulness.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Even the contractor appeared flabbergasted. His mouth stayed in a half-open&nbsp; position, like a marionette waiting for its strings to be tugged.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">“Yes. Leave it,” Robert said again, speaking to the notion that someone in the room had asked him to clarify his words. No one had, but Robert understood the&nbsp; silence.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">What were the chances that an Indian burial ground would be found on the bucolic site where Robert and Kelsey had chosen to build their dream home? Why in the world would Robert not want to have the remains carted away, thought Kelsey. The last thing they needed were Indian poltergeists meandering around their home while the two of them were trying to renovate their marriage.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Kelsey, usually deferential to her husband, knew that now was the time to make her position heard.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">She tried to cajole Robert away from the direction he was heading. “Sweetheart,” she cooed. “We don’t want to build on a site with human remains. It would be irreverent to the dead.”</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Immediately, she saw contempt in Robert’s eyes; it was a subtle reminder of how he often viewed her as superficial and self-absorbed.“What would be irreverent,” said Robert, his voice dripping with condescension, “would be to desecrate these Native graves and move them from their final resting place. Remember the culture.”</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">No, Kelsey did not “remember the culture.” She could not care less about the culture. However, Robert, the history professor, was obviously enthralled by the contractor’s findings. He had an innate way of understanding other cultures and other people that amazed Kelsey. He did not have that gift with her.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">But something inside Kelsey said this was too much. She believed wholeheartedly in ghosts and could not imagine a life of them haunting her, rattling her cupboards, and shaking her floorboards.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Kelsey had an unnerving sensation that problems were ahead.Questions:</SPAN></SPAN></P>

C++ maintains almost all aspects of the C language, while simplifying memory management and adding several features - including a new datatype known as a class (you will learn more about these later) - to allow object-oriented programming. C++ maintains the features of C which allowed for low-level memory access but also gives the programmer new tools to simplify memory management.<BR><BR>C++ used for:<BR><BR>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to create small programs or large applications. It can be used to make CGI scripts or console-only DOS programs. C++ allows you to create programs to do almost anything you need to do. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, has put together a partial list of applications written in C++.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

If there is a cycle, the one that goes 2 nodes each time will eventually meet the one that goes slower. If that is the case, then you will know the linked-list is a cycle.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid pointer. If the Pointer parameter is a null value, no action will occur. The realloc subroutine changes the size of the block of memory pointed to by the Pointer parameter to the number of bytes specified by the Size parameter and returns a new pointer to the block. The pointer specified by the Pointer parameter must have been created with the malloc, calloc, or realloc subroutines and not been deallocated with the free or realloc subroutines. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid pointer.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">Function overloading: C++ enables several functions of the same name to be defined, as long as these functions have different sets of parameters (at least as far as their types are concerned). This capability is called function overloading. When an overloaded function is called, the C++ compiler selects the proper function by examining the number, types and order of the arguments in the call. Function overloading is commonly used to create several functions of the same name that perform similar tasks but on different data types.<BR>Operator overloading allows existing C++ operators to be redefined so that they work on objects of user-defined classes. Overloaded operators are syntactic sugar for equivalent function "	<B>Aricent</B> Technical-C	21	3	3/20/2014	0

First thing i would like to tell you is that&nbsp;aricent was flextronics earlier.you can also check for&nbsp;flextronics &nbsp;papers on freshersworld site.</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><STRONG><U><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">What to study for written test.</FONT></U></STRONG> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">To clear written you need not study any thing particular but what you can do is ,you can go through all the previous papers present in freshersworld site. because you are never sure about what will come in the paper.But you can go through&nbsp; some core&nbsp; subjects that would help- you after written also.</FONT> </DIV>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">In interview At the start they will ask you for your best subjects.But these subjects they want you to know about.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><B>1</B></FONT><U><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><B>.Any language C or C++</B></FONT></P>
<DIV align=left></U><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Books to be followed-&gt;<BR>test your skills in c by kanetkar,&nbsp;<BR>C by Dennis ritchie are sufficient.</FONT> </DIV>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Initially for written you would be given a choice for C or C++, and based upon your choice your technical interview would depend. like if you choose C you will be asked about C only, in technical interview.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><U><B><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">2.data structures</FONT></B></U></P>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Books to be followed-&gt;<BR>Go through data&nbsp; structures by schoum series(initially) then you can go through other books also for programs in c.<BR>prepare well&nbsp; on stacks,sorting algorithims,trees,queues ,linked lists, implementation in C&nbsp; is very important.In interview they will ask you to write programs.like add an item to list,delete a particular node,quick sort program etc<BR>questions on trees will be there in written test.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>3<U>.operating system</U><BR></B>Go through book by gelvin on operating system<BR>very few questions will be there in written.But for interview you can prepare on memory management(virtual memory),paging,segmentation,semaphores, real time operating systems,and other type of operating systems,deadlock,process and different states etc.</FONT> </DIV>
<P align=left><B><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><U>4.computer networks</U><BR></FONT></B></P>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">You can go through tanenboum.for CSE&nbsp; students only overview is sufficient like OSI,TCP IP Model<BR>basic idea of bridges,hub,switches,gateways,routers, packet/circuit/message switching etc.<BR>for electronics&nbsp; students you can go to details of GPRS,GSM and also&nbsp;prepare well on digital electronics and topics like half adder,full adder X mod counter (X=5,10,20 etc) k maps</FONT> </DIV>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">So these are the four subjects by mastering which you can&nbsp; be there in flextronics(Aricent)</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">-&gt;there will be two technical interviews by different people.usually it lasts for long time(1.5 hr average) but it depends&nbsp;bility like for me both last for 25 minutes approx.<BR>after that you will undergo an HR If you have cleared both the technicals then it would be just a formality. But some usual questions like your hobbies,negative and positive points.how will you manage your team members in case you are manager etc can be asked,They basically want to see how you will behave in a group,always take the descision like a team not as a single member.you should be very coperative and positive minded.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><U><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES</FONT></U></P>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">The most important thing is be particular in your answer.in case you donot know anything about something please do not guess.in this situation :""i donot know ""or ""i am not comfortable with this""&nbsp;would be the best answer.you may or may not be able to give all the answers,Don't worry in that case.if you are able to give 60 percent of the answers then you can make it.</FONT></P>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG><U>The most important thing</U></STRONG>&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;like when&nbsp;they question you and in case you are not able to answer that ,then they will ask you another question related to that which will basically a solution to your question or some hint so listen to that carefully and use that to answer the main question. I will give you my example. in first technical he asked me<BR>int x;</FONT> </DIV>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">X=2;</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Y=X&gt;&gt;-2;(rt shift)<BR>print Y;</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">What will be the output?</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">So i was not able to recall how to represent a negative no in binary.so he asked me do you know 2's complement<BR>I said yes and got to know that a negative no can be represented in 2's complement form.So i ussed his hint to solve that question and i used that so many times.This experience was common in second interview also.same thing happened to me and ultimately i got the answer.</FONT></P>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">-&gt;Don't get nervous in case they ask you questions&nbsp;just one after other very fastly they&nbsp;do &nbsp;just to check whether you can bear pressure or not,</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">-&gt;look into their (interviewer's) eyes to show your confidence,&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Last Most important point please keep in mind</FONT> </DIV>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">That its God and luck above all .if its your day everything will go according to you.But if its not then......</FONT></STRONG></P>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;(HOPE FOR THE BEST AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST&nbsp;)</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=left><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><BR>So need not worry just trust in god and do the right.In case you feel any thing to be be ambigious or you want to ask any thing you can mail me or call me.</FONT> </DIV>

<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Hi frnds!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">I am going to share my recent experience with Aricent. I hope it will help you to prepare for the Off Campuses. The written test was held on 25-feb (sunday), it was an invitation based selection process.<BR><BR><B>Written Exam<BR></B>Aricent Written exam has 7 sections. Each section has 10/15/20 questions and the time given is 1 min per question. So be carefull.<BR><BR>1) simple english (prepositions, verbs etc.). you can easily clear this section if u have general idea about english grammer. You can follow any english book if u have problem like new style etc.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">2) reasoning . this section has reasoning questions based on puzzles, seating arrangements, cubes puzzles etc. R.s Agarwal is sufficient</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">3) quntitative . it has ques like sets using venn diagrams, time and work etc.R.s agarwal is sufficient here again.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">4) DS and OS. It is the most difficult section as I feel. It has 20 ques and and 20 mins duration. DS was tough and you should be well prepared with trees, graphs and sorting (with programs). there was prog with 1-2 pages to find output or error. 1 question from UNIX also.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">5)C/C++. next section is of C or C++ programming. they will ask u to have one lang. C paper is full of pointers and strings, arrays and other questions. Prefer Exploring c and pointers in c to solve. I opted for C.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">6) This section is unseen pessage. Not very tough english but the questions are confusing. you should read the pessage at least twice.<BR>I got 15 mins to read it and thereafter given ques based on it with duration of 10 min for 10 ques.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">7) the last section is E-mail writing. They assigned a problem specification and you have 5 mins to write email. try to write it in professional way using proper grammer puntuation and english.<BR>I have given that a regular customer of a store wants to exchange the costume after 5 days but the store rules says it should be exchanged within 3 days.So how can u deny for xchange ?</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">They declared the result after 1 hour and I have cleared the Written exam.</FONT>

They are simple aptitude bits&nbsp;you can easily do around 20-25 of them<BR><BR>Next is verbal- 20 bits 20 minutes.

One question&nbsp;I can't figure out is the ""Time complexity of cocktail sort"". I haven't even heard of such kinda sort technique.

<P>Candidates can relax here. No elimination in this round.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><U>3) Technical round</U></STRONG></P>
<P>This is really tough for candidates from ECE &amp; EEE. because we have to write the code for data structures problems.</P>
<P>My questions are :</P>
<P>a) Write the code for inserting a node in singly linked list including 3 cases of inserting in first, last, middle?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>b) What is difference between Binary tree &amp; Binary search tree?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>c) Write code for inserting a node in Binary search tree?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>d) What is meant by scheduling and why we need it in OS?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>e) What is OSI layer protocol (each layer functionality) and why we are not using it now?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>f) Why is meant by pipelining and how it is working?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>g) What is &nbsp;the mechanism that increasing todays computer performance with respect to CO?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>h) What are the process models you know?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i) Compare Raid model with water fall model in SE?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I answered all because &nbsp;prepared for GATE exam. only 20 are shortlisted out of 40.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><U>4) HR Round</U></STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Really my HR is not so cool. He conducted me stress interview.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He didn't asked any common question which we already prepare like tell me about yourself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He gave me two solution less problems and asked me to solve and give to him at least 10 solutions</P>
<P>for each.I understand he is testing my patience and logical ability, so I put my best to solve them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He didn't said anything positive and gave negative postures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After listening my approach, he said ""its okay and you can go now"".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So they take three days to give result. finally they has selected 12 out of 20. &nbsp;With god grace i am one of them.</P>
<P>Good luck guys, see you there in Aricent :)</P>

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>Aricent possible interview questions &nbsp;</B></SPAN></SPAN><BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P><BR><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>Tell me about yourself: -&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>The most often asked question in interviews. You need to have a short statement prepared in your mind. Be careful that it does not sound rehearsed. Limit it to work-related items unless instructed otherwise. Talk about things you have done and jobs you have held that relate to the position you are interviewing for. Start with the item farthest back and work up to the present.<BR><BR><B>What experience do you have in this field? -&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>Speak about specifics that relate to the position you are applying for. If you do not have specific experience, get as close as you can.<BR><BR><B>Do you consider yourself successful?</B><BR><BR>You should always answer yes and briefly explain why. A good explanation is that you have set goals, and you have met some and are on track to achieve the others.<BR><BR><B>What do co-workers say about you?</B><BR><BR>Be prepared with a quote or two from co-workers. Either a specific statement or a paraphrase will work. Jill Clark, a co-worker at Smith Company, always said I was the hardest workers she had ever known. It is as powerful as Jill having said it at the interview herself.<BR><BR><B>What do you know about this organization?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>This question is one reason to do some research on the organization before the interview. Find out where they have been and where they are going. What are the current issues and who are the major players?<BR><BR><B>What have you done to improve your knowledge in the last year?</B><BR><BR>Try to include improvement activities that relate to the job. A wide variety of activities can be mentioned as positive self-improvement. Have some good ones handy to mention.<BR>Are you applying for other jobs? - Be honest but do not spend a lot of time in this area. Keep the focus on this job and what you can do for this organization. Anything else is a distraction.<BR><BR><B>Why do you want to work for this organization?</B><BR><BR>This may take some thought and certainly, should be based on the research you have done on the organization. Sincerity is extremely important here and will easily be sensed. Relate it to your long-term career goals.<BR><BR><B>Do you know anyone who works for us?</B><BR><BR>Be aware of the policy on relatives working for the organization. This can affect your answer even though they asked about friends not relatives. Be careful to mention a friend only if they are well thought of.<BR><BR><B>What kind of salary do you need?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>A loaded question. A nasty little game that you will probably lose if you answer first. So, do not answer it. Instead, say something like, That’s a tough question. Can you tell me the range for this position? In most cases, the interviewer, taken off guard, will tell you. If not, say that it can depend on the details of the job. Then give a wide range.<BR><BR><B>Are you a team player?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>You are, of course, a team player. Be sure to have examples ready. Specifics that show you often perform for the good of the team rather than for yourself are good evidence of your team attitude. Do not brag, just say it in a matter-of-fact tone. This is a key point.<BR><BR><B>How long would you expect to work for us if hired?</B><BR><BR>Specifics here are not good. Something like this should work: I’d like it to be a long time. Or As long as we both feel I’m doing a good job.<BR><BR><B>Have you ever had to fire anyone? How did you feel about that?</B><BR><BR>This is serious. Do not make light of it or in any way seem like you like to fire people. At the same time, you will do it when it is the right thing to do. When it comes to the organization versus the individual who has created a harmful situation, you will protect the organization. Remember firing is not the same as layoff or reduction in force.<BR><BR><B>What is your philosophy towards work?</B><BR><BR>The interviewer is not looking for a long or flowery dissertation here. Do you have strong feelings that the job gets done? Yes. That’s the type of answer that works best here. Short and positive, showing a benefit to the organization.<BR><BR><B>If you had enough money to retire right now, would you?&nbsp;</B><BR><BR>Answer yes if you would. But since you need to work, this is the type of work you prefer. Do not say yes if you do not mean it.<BR>Have you ever been asked to leave a position? - If you have not, say no. If you have, be honest, brief and avoid saying negative things about the people or organization involved.<BR><BR><B>Explain how you would be an asset to this organization?</B><BR><BR>You should be anxious for this question. It gives you a chance to highlight your best points as they relate to the position being discussed. Give a little advance thought to this relationship.<BR><BR><B>Why should we hire you?</B><BR><BR>Point out how your assets meet what the organization needs. Do not mention any other candidates to make a comparison.<BR>Tell me about a suggestion you have made - Have a good one ready. Be sure and use a suggestion that was accepted and was then considered successful. One related to the type of work applied for is a real plus.<BR><BR><B>What is your greatest strength?</B><BR><BR>Numerous answers are good, just stay positive. A few good examples: Your ability to prioritize, Your problem-solving skills, Your ability to work under pressure, Your ability to focus on projects, Your professional expertise, Your leadership skills, Your positive attitude .<BR><BR><B>Tell me about your dream job.?</B><BR><BR>Stay away from a specific job. You cannot win. If you say the job you are contending for is it, you strain credibility. If you say another job is it, you plant the suspicion that you will be dissatisfied with this position if hired. The best is to stay genetic and say something like: A job where I love the work, like the people, can contribute and can’t wait to get to work.</SPAN></SPAN></P>"	<B>Aricent</B> Interview-HR Interview	21	3	4/18/2013	0

The GD is to check how you behave, participate and contibute in a group, how much importance do you give to the group objective as well as your own, how well do you listen to viewpoints of others and how open-minded are you in accepting views contrary to your own.

<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>This year Aricent visited our campus students were allowed cur oof aggregate was 65%. ECE, TCE, CSE, ISE, EEE, MTech, MCA branches Jobs positions offered software engineer, development or testing will be decided later. Package was 3.5lpa.from TCE branch. A short descriptions of aricent campus placement procedure<BR><BR>Aricent was section aptitude on line test&nbsp;<BR>Verbal ability, aptitude, reasoning and technical questions&nbsp;<BR><BR>Verbal is just basic English. Just going through any competitive exam book for verbal should be enough, 25 questions with 25 minutes were given for this. Quant is quite easy too. A few questions might trip you, but never mind, if you can get most of them right its sufficient. Here 35 minutes is provided for 25 questions. Programming questions are almost in pseudocode only.<BR><BR>Knowing basics of C, C++ and data structures should be more than enough. Here again 25 minutes for 35 questions. Logical is also simple. Here 24 questions with 25 minutes is provided.<BR><BR>Sectional cut-off is present so try to perform well in all sections.<BR><BR>Aricent second section&nbsp;<BR><BR>Once aptitude is cleared, a critical incident form is given to be filled. It has few questions as about yourself, your approach towards the job and few other questions regarding your life experiences as in what you did when you were put up in some sort of a situation.<BR><BR>Aricent third section Group discussion GD<BR><BR>Next round is group discussion. Do not panic, this is a non elimination round.<BR>Topic will either be given to you or you will only be asked to choose a topic. Dont overpower others and you dont have to speak too much either. It'll be in a group of ten and half an hour is alloted for the group. If u can fit in 3-4 points in between you should be fine.<BR><BR>**Do not ignore it as it is non-elimination. The scores of gd will be included along with the next rounds for elimination.<BR><BR>Aricent technical round<BR><BR>Next comes technical round. This is an interview round. As am from telecommunication branch, I can give info about this for ECE, TCE and EEE branches. Even though we are from electronics background they expect us to know the basics of C,C++ and data structures. Some will be confused as to how much is basics. For C till structures and unions should be enough, C++ till classes and inheritance, and data structures only linked lists, queue, stacks and trees should be good.<BR><BR>Do know the 3 basic sorting algorithms, ie, bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort. And be thorough with the basics of core subjects, mainly analog electronics, logic design, microcontroller, microprocessors, communication subjects (analog and digital) and communication networks too. If you had opted for OS, know that well too. And if you dont know anything just say it.<BR><BR>If you are asked about a subject you've never studied at all, say it directly but in a polite way, instead of giving wrong answers. And yes they will ask you to write basic programs. From this round onwards luck also matters, as to who will take your interview. The interviewer may be easy, moderate or tough.<BR><BR>I had a moderate one. :) Here many get eliminated and the elimination is based on a combination of gd and technical scores.<BR><BR>** For other branches such as CS, IS, MCA etc, know your programming well and be strong with the basics of your core subjects. I dont know much about what they ask candidates from these branches.<BR><BR>Next is the HR round. Once you reach till here, you are 95% placed. This round is one of the simplest and dangerous one. I liked it. Do you homework and know a few things on how to behave in an HR interview. Until you behave normally and not like a psychopath you will get through. None of the questions will be based on anything you study or any puzzles. Just normal interaction to check your personality. Remain calm and answer sensibly in a polite manner.<BR><BR>They announced the results in less than hour or so for us as it was campus recruitment's. No idea about off campus. I was delighted when my name was called in the list of placed candidates.<BR><BR>Keep yourself refreshed all day, because my HR round actually happened at 09:30 pm and results were announced at 10:30 pm. It will be a long day.<BR><BR>As for statistics, nearly 400 students had applied. Aricent recruited with a girls:boys ratio of 4:1. They can change this ratio anytime.<BR><BR>Out of 400, 90 cleared aptitude.<BR><BR>After technical only 49 were left.<BR><BR>After HR 35 got selected. 25 girls and 8 guys. Lucky to be one of the 8 guys.&nbsp;<BR><BR>93 students were short listed from around 400 students.</FONT></P>"	<B>Aricent</B> Question-Paper	21	3	8/2/2012	0

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>Aricent 100 technical questions with answers</B></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>1. What does static variable mean?<BR>Ans: Static variables are the variables which retain their values between the function calls. They are initialized only once their scope is within the function in which they are defined.</B><BR><BR>2. What is a pointer?<BR>Ans: Pointers are variables which stores the address of another variable. That variable may be a scalar (including another pointer), or an aggregate (array or structure). The pointed-to object may be part of a larger object, such as a field of a structure or an element in an array.&nbsp;<BR><BR>3. What are the uses of a pointer?<BR>Ans: Pointer is used in the following cases<BR>i) It is used to access array elements<BR>ii) It is used for dynamic memory allocation.<BR>iii) It is used in Call by reference<BR>iv) It is used in data structures like trees, graph, linked list etc.&nbsp;<BR><BR>4. What is a structure?<BR>Ans: Structure constitutes a super data type which represents several different data types in a single unit. A structure can be initialized if it is static or global.&nbsp;<BR><BR>5. What is a union?<BR>Ans: Union is a collection of heterogeneous data type but it uses efficient memory utilization technique by allocating enough memory to hold the largest member. Here a single area of memory contains values of different types at different time. A union can never be initialized.&nbsp;<BR><BR>6. What are the differences between structures and union?<BR>Ans: A structure variable contains each of the named members, and its size is large enough to hold all the members. Structure elements are of same size. A union contains one of the named members at a given time and is large enough to hold the largest member. Union element can be of different sizes.&nbsp;<BR><BR>7. What are the differences between structures and arrays?<BR>Ans: Structure is a collection of heterogeneous data type but array is a collection of homogeneous data types.&nbsp;<BR>Array&nbsp;<BR>1-It is a collection of data items of same data type.<BR>2-It has declaration only<BR>3-.There is no keyword.<BR>4- array name represent the address of the starting element.&nbsp;<BR>Structure<BR>1-It is a collection of data items of different data type.<BR>2- It has declaration and definition<BR>3- keyword struct is used<BR>4-Structure name is known as tag it is the short hand notation of the declaration.&nbsp;<BR><BR>8. In header files whether functions are declared or defined?<BR>Ans: Functions are declared within header file. That is function prototypes exist in a header file,not function bodies. They are defined in library (lib).&nbsp;<BR><BR>9. What are the differences between malloc () and calloc ()?<BR>Ans: Malloc Calloc 1-Malloc takes one argument Malloc(a);where a number of bytes 2-memory allocated contains garbage values&nbsp;<BR>1-Calloc takes two arguments Calloc(b,c) where b no of object and c size of object<BR>2-It initializes the contains of block of memory to zerosMalloc takes one argument, memory allocated contains garbage values.&nbsp;<BR>It allocates contiguous memory locations. Calloc takes two arguments, memory allocated contains all zeros, and the memory allocated is not contiguous.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>10. What are macros? What are its advantages and disadvantages?<BR>Ans: Macros are abbreviations for lengthy and frequently used statements. When a macro is called the entire code is substituted by a single line though the macro definition is of several lines. The advantage of macro is that it reduces the time taken for control transfer as in case of function. The disadvantage of it is here the entire code is substituted so the program becomes lengthy if a macro is called several times.&nbsp;<BR><BR>11. Difference between pass by reference and pass by value?<BR>Ans: Pass by reference passes a pointer to the value. This allows the callee to modify the variable directly.Pass by value gives a copy of the value to the callee. This allows the callee tomodify the value without modifying the variable. (In other words, the callee simply cannot modify the variable, since it lacks a reference to it.)<BR><BR>12. What is static identifier?<BR>Ans: A file-scope variable that is declared static is visible only to functions within that file. A function-scope or block-scope variable that is declared as static is visible only within that scope. Furthermore, static variables only have a single instance. In the case of function- or block-scope variables, this means that the variable is not ?automatic and thus retains its value across function invocations.&nbsp;<BR><BR>13. Where is the auto variables stored?<BR>Ans: Auto variables can be stored anywhere, so long as recursion works. Practically, they‘re stored on the stack. It is not necessary that always a stack exist. You could theoretically allocate function invocation records from the heap.&nbsp;<BR><BR>14. Where does global, static, and local, register variables, free memory and C Program instructions get stored?<BR>Ans: Global: Wherever the linker puts them. Typically the ?BSS segment on many platforms.Static: Again, wherever the linker puts them. Often, they‘re intermixed with the globals. Theonly difference between globals and statics is whether the linker will resolve the symbols across compilation units.Local: Typically on the stack, unless the variable gets register allocated and never spills.Register: Nowadays, these are equivalent to ?Local variables. They live on the stackunless they get register-allocated.&nbsp;<BR><BR>15. Difference between arrays and linked list?<BR>Ans: An array is a repeated pattern of variables in contiguous storage. A linked list is a set of structures scattered through memory, held together by pointers in each element that point to the next element. With an array, we can (on most architectures) move from one element to the nextby adding a fixed constant to the integer value of the pointer. With a linked list, there is a ?next<BR>pointer in each structure which says what element comes next.&nbsp;<BR>16. What are enumerations?<BR>Ans: They are a list of named integer-valued constants. Example:enum color { black , orange=4, yellow, green, blue, violet };This declaration defines the symbols ?black ?orange ?yellow etc. to have the values ?1,?4,?5,… etc. The difference between an enumeration and a macro is that the enum actually declares a type, and therefore can be type checked.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>17. Describe about storage allocation and scope of global, extern, static, local and register variables?<BR>Ans:<BR>Globals have application-scope. They‘re available in any compilation unit that includes an appropriate declaration (usually brought from a header file). They‘re stored wherever the linker puts them, usually a place called the ?BSS segment Extern?&nbsp;<BR>This is essentially ?global.Static: Stored the same place as globals, typically, but only available to the compilation unit that contains them. If they are block-scope global, only available within that block and its subblocks.<BR>Local: Stored on the stack, typically. Only available in that block and its subblocks. (Although pointers to locals can be passed to functions invoked from within a scope where that local is valid.)<BR>Register: See tirade above on ?local vs. ?register.The only difference is that the C compiler will not let you take the address of something you‘ve declared as ?register&nbsp;<BR><BR>18. What are register variables? What are the advantages of using register variables?<BR>Ans: If a variable is declared with a register storage class,it is known as register variable.The register variable is stored in the cpu register instead of main memory.Frequently used variables are declared as register variable as it‘s access time is faster.&nbsp;<BR><BR>19. What is the use of typedef?<BR>Ans: The typedef help in easier modification when the programs are ported to another machine. A descriptive new name given to the existing data type may be easier to understand the code.&nbsp;<BR><BR>20. Can we specify variable field width in a scanf() format string? If possible how?<BR>Ans: All field widths are variable with scanf(). You can specify a maximum field width for a given field by placing an integer value between the ?%‘ and the field type specifier. (e.g. %64s). Such aspecifier will still accept a narrower field width. The one exception is %#c (where # is an integer). This reads EXACTLY # characters, and it is the only way to specify a fixed field width with scanf().&nbsp;<BR><BR>21. Out of fgets() and gets() which function is safe to use and why?<BR>Ans: fgets() is safer than gets(), because we can specify a maximum input length. Neither one is completely safe, because the compiler can‘t prove that programmer won‘t overflow the buffer he pass to fgets ().<BR><BR>22. Difference between strdup and strcpy?<BR>Ans: Both copy a string. strcpy wants a buffer to copy into. strdup allocates a buffer using malloc(). Unlike strcpy(), strdup() is not specified by ANSI .&nbsp;<BR><BR>23. What is recursion?<BR>Ans: A recursion function is one which calls itself either directly or indirectly it must halt at a definite point to avoid infinite recursion.&nbsp;<BR><BR>24. Differentiate between for loop and a while loop? What are it uses?<BR>Ans: For executing a set of statements fixed number of times we use for loop while when the number of iterations to be performed is not known in advance we use while loop.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>25. What is storage class? What are the different storage classes in C?<BR>Ans: Storage class is an attribute that changes the behavior of a variable. It controls the lifetime, scope and linkage. The storage classes in c are auto, register, and extern, static, typedef.&nbsp;<BR><BR>26. What the advantages of using Unions?<BR>Ans: When the C compiler is allocating memory for unions it will always reserve enough room for the largest member.&nbsp;<BR><BR>27. What is the difference between Strings and Arrays?<BR>Ans: String is a sequence of characters ending with NULL .it can be treated as a one dimensional array of characters terminated by a NULL character.&nbsp;<BR><BR>28. What is a far pointer? Where we use it?<BR>Ans: In large data model (compact, large, huge) the address B0008000 is acceptable because in these model all pointers to data are 32bits long. If we use small data model(tiny, small, medium) the<BR>above address won‘t work since in these model each pointer is 16bits long. If we are working in a small data model and want to access the address B0008000 then we use far pointer. Far pointer is always treated as a 32bit pointer and contains a segment address and offset address both of 16bits each. Thus the address is represented using segment : offset format B000h:8000h. For any given memory address there are many possible far address segment : offset pair. The segment register contains the address where the segment begins and offset register contains the offset of data/code from where segment begins.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>29. What is a huge pointer?<BR>Ans: Huge pointer is 32bit long containing segment address and offset address. Huge pointers are normalized pointers so for any given memory address there is only one possible huge address segment: offset pair. Huge pointer arithmetic is doe with calls to special subroutines so its arithmetic slower than any other pointers.&nbsp;<BR><BR>30. What is a normalized pointer, how do we normalize a pointer?<BR>Ans: It is a 32bit pointer, which has as much of its value in the segment register as possible.Since a segment can start every 16bytes so the offset will have a value from 0 to F. for normalization convert the address into 20bit address then use the 16bit for segment address and 4bit for the offset address. Given a pointer 500D: 9407,we convert it to a 20bitabsolute address549D7,Which then normalized to 549D:0007.&nbsp;<BR><BR>31. What is near pointer?<BR>Ans: A near pointer is 16 bits long. It uses the current content of the CS (code segment) register(if the pointer is pointing to code) or current contents of DS (data segment) register (if the pointer is pointing to data) for the segment part, the offset part is stored in a 16 bit near pointer. Using near pointer limits the data/code to 64kb segment.<BR><BR>32. In C, why is the void pointer useful? When would you use it?<BR>Ans: The void pointer is useful because it is a generic pointer that any pointer can be cast into and back again without loss of information.&nbsp;<BR><BR>33. What is a NULL Pointer? Whether it is same as an uninitialized pointer?<BR>Ans: Null pointer is a pointer which points to nothing but uninitialized pointer may point to anywhere.&nbsp;<BR><BR>34. Are pointers integer?<BR>Ans: No, pointers are not integers. A pointer is an address. It is a positive number.&nbsp;<BR><BR>35. What does the error ‘Null Pointer Assignment’ means and what causes this error?<BR>Ans: As null pointer points to nothing so accessing a uninitialized pointer or invalid location may cause an error.&nbsp;<BR><BR>36. What is generic pointer in C?<BR>Ans: In C void* acts as a generic pointer. When other pointer types are assigned to generic pointer, conversions are applied automatically (implicit conversion).&nbsp;<BR><BR>37. Are the expressions arr and &amp;arr same for an array of integers?<BR>Ans: Yes for array of integers they are same.&nbsp;<BR><BR>38. IMP&gt;How pointer variables are initialized?<BR>Ans: Pointer variables are initialized by one of the following ways.<BR>I. Static memory allocation<BR>II. Dynamic memory allocation&nbsp;<BR><BR>39. What is static memory allocation?<BR>Ans: Compiler allocates memory space for a declared variable. By using the address of operator, the reserved address is obtained and this address is assigned to a pointer variable. This way of assigning pointer value to a pointer variable at compilation time is known as static memory allocation.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>40. What is dynamic memory allocation?<BR>Ans: A dynamic memory allocation uses functions such as malloc() or calloc() to get memory dynamically. If these functions are used to get memory dynamically and the values returned by these function are assigned to pointer variables, such a way of allocating memory at run time is known as dynamic memory allocation.&nbsp;<BR><BR>41. What is the purpose of realloc?&nbsp;<BR>Ans: It increases or decreases the size of dynamically allocated array. The function realloc (ptr,n) uses two arguments. The first argument ptr is a pointer to a block of memory for which the size is to be altered. The second argument specifies the new size. The size may be increased or decreased. If sufficient space is not available to the old region the function may create a new region.<BR><BR>42. What is pointer to a pointer?<BR>Ans: If a pointer variable points another pointer value. Such a situation is known as a pointer to a pointer.<BR>Example:<BR>int *p1,**p2,v=10;<BR>P1=&amp;v; p2=&amp;p1;<BR>Here p2 is a pointer to a pointer.&nbsp;<BR><BR>43. What is an array of pointers?<BR>Ans: if the elements of an array are addresses, such an array is called an array of pointers.&nbsp;<BR><BR>44. Difference between linker and linkage?<BR>Ans: Linker converts an object code into an executable code by linking together the necessary built in functions. The form and place of declaration where the variable is declared in a program determine the linkage of variable.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>45. Is it possible to have negative index in an array?<BR>Ans: Yes it is possible to index with negative value provided there are data stored in this location. Even if it is illegal to refer to the elements that are out of array bounds, the compiler will not produce error because C has no check on the bounds of an array.<BR><BR>46. Why is it necessary to give the size of an array in an array declaration?<BR>Ans: When an array is declared, the compiler allocates a base address and reserves enough space in memory for all the elements of the array. The size is required to allocate the required space and hence size must be mentioned.&nbsp;<BR><BR>47. What modular programming?<BR>Ans: If a program is large, it is subdivided into a number of smaller programs that are called modules or subprograms. If a complex problem is solved using more modules, this approach is known as modular programming.&nbsp;<BR><BR>48. What is a function?<BR>Ans: A large program is subdivided into a number of smaller programs or subprograms. Each subprogram specifies one or more actions to be performed for the larger program. Such sub programs are called functions.&nbsp;<BR><BR>49. What is an argument?<BR>Ans: An argument is an entity used to pass data from the calling to a called function.&nbsp;<BR><BR>50. What are built in functions?<BR>Ans: The functions that are predefined and supplied along with the compiler are known as builtin functions.Theyarealsoknown aslibrary functions.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>51. Difference between formal argument and actual argument?<BR>Ans: Formal arguments are the arguments available in the function definition. They are preceded by their own data type. Actual arguments are available in the function call. These arguments are given as constants or variables or expressions to pass the values to the function.<BR><BR>52. Is it possible to have more than one main() function in a C program ?<BR>Ans: The function main() can appear only once. The program execution starts from main.&nbsp;<BR><BR>53. What is the difference between an enumeration and a set of pre-processor # defines?<BR>Ans: There is hardly any difference between the two, except that #defines has a global effect(throughout the file) whereas an enumeration can have an effect local to the block if desired.Some advantages of enumeration are that the numeric values are automatically assigned whereasin #define we have to explicitly define them. A disadvantage is that we have no control over the size of enumeration variables.&nbsp;<BR><BR>54. How are Structure passing and returning implemented by the complier?<BR>Ans: When structures are passed as argument to functions, the entire structure is typically pushed on the stack. To avoid this overhead many programmer often prefer to pass pointers to structure instead of actual structures. Structures are often returned from functions in a location pointed to by an extra, compiler-supported ?hidden‘ argument to the function.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>55. IMP&gt;what is the similarity between a Structure, Union and enumeration?<BR>Ans: All of them let the programmer to define new data type.&nbsp;<BR><BR>56. Can a Structure contain a Pointer to itself?<BR>Ans: Yes such structures are called self-referential structures.&nbsp;<BR><BR>57. How can we read/write Structures from/to data files?<BR>Ans: To write out a structure we can use fwrite() as Fwrite( &amp;e, sizeof(e),1,fp);Where e is a structure variable. A corresponding fread() invocation can read the structure back from file. calling fwrite() it writes out sizeof(e) bytes from the address &amp;e. Data files written as memory images with fwrite(),however ,will not be portable, particularly if they contain floating point fields or Pointers. This is because memory layout of structures is machine and compiler dependent. Therefore, structures written as memory images cannot necessarily be read back by programs running on other machine, and this is the important concern if the data files you‘re writing will ever be interchanged between machines.&nbsp;<BR><BR>58. Write a program which employs Recursion?<BR>Ans: int fact(int n) { return n &gt; 1 ? n * fact(n – 1) : 1; }&nbsp;<BR><BR>59.Write a program which uses Command Line Arguments?<BR>Ans:&nbsp;<BR>#include<BR>void main(int argc,char *argv[])<BR>{<BR>int i;<BR>clrscr();<BR>for(i=0;i<BR>printf(?\n%d?,argv[i]);<BR>}&nbsp;<BR><BR>60. Difference between array and pointer?<BR>Ans: array&nbsp;<BR>1- Array allocates space automatically<BR>2- It cannot be resized<BR>3- It cannot be reassigned<BR>4- sizeof (arrayname) gives the number of bytes occupied by the array.&nbsp;<BR>Pointer<BR>1-Explicitly assigned to point to an allocated space.<BR>2-It can be sized using realloc()<BR>3-pointer can be reassigned.<BR>4-sizeof (p) returns the number of bytes used to store the pointer variable p.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>61. What do the ‘c’ and ‘v’ in argc and argv stand for?<BR>Ans: The c in argc(argument count) stands for the number of command line argument the program is invoked with and v in argv(argument vector) is a pointer to an array of character string that contain the arguments.<BR><BR>62. IMP&gt;what are C tokens?<BR>Ans: There are six classes of tokens: identifier, keywords, constants, string literals, operators and other separators.&nbsp;<BR><BR>63. What are C identifiers?<BR>Ans: These are names given to various programming element such as variables, function, arrays.It is a combination of letter, digit and underscore.It should begin with letter. Backspace is not allowed.&nbsp;<BR><BR>64. Difference between syntax vs logical error?<BR>Ans:<BR>Syntax Error&nbsp;<BR>1-These involves validation of syntax of language.<BR>2-compiler prints diagnostic message.&nbsp;<BR>Logical Error<BR>1-logical error are caused by an incorrect algorithm or by a statement mistyped in such a way<BR>that it doesn‘t violet syntax of language.<BR>2-difficult to find.&nbsp;<BR><BR>65. What is preincrement and post increment?<BR>Ans: ++n (pre increment) increments n before its value is used in an assignment operation or any expression containing it. n++ (post increment) does increment after the value of n is used.&nbsp;<BR><BR>66. Write a program to interchange 2 variables without using the third one.<BR>Ans:<BR>a ^= b; ie a=a^b<BR>b ^= a; ie b=b^a;<BR>a ^= b ie a=a^b;<BR>here the numbers are converted into binary and then xor operation is performed.<BR>You know, you‘re just asking ?have you seen this overly clever trick that‘s not worth applying on modern architectures and only really applies to integer variables?<BR><BR>67. What is the maximum combined length of command line arguments including the space between adjacent arguments?<BR>Ans: It depends on the operating system.&nbsp;<BR><BR>68. What are bit fields? What is the use of bit fields in a Structure declaration?<BR>Ans: A bit field is a set of adjacent bits within a single implementation based storage unit that we will call a ?word The syntax of field definition and access is based on structure. Struct { unsigned int k :1;<BR>unsigned int l :1;unsigned int m :1;}flags;the number following the colon represents the field width in bits.Flag is a variable that containsthree bit fields.&nbsp;<BR><BR>69. What is a preprocessor, what are the advantages of preprocessor?<BR>Ans: A preprocessor processes the source code program before it passes through the compiler.&nbsp;<BR>1- a preprocessor involves the readability of program<BR>2- It facilitates easier modification<BR>3- It helps in writing portable programs<BR>4- It enables easier debugging<BR>5- It enables testing a part of program<BR>6- It helps in developing generalized program&nbsp;<BR><BR>70. What are the facilities provided by preprocessor?<BR>Ans:<BR>1-file inclusion<BR>2-substitution facility<BR>3-conditional compilation&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>71. What are the two forms of #include directive?<BR>Ans:<BR>1.#include?filename?<BR>2.#include the first form is used to search the directory that contains the source file.If the search fails in the home directory it searches the implementation defined locations.In the second form ,the<BR>preprocessor searches the file only in the implementation defined locations.<BR><BR>72. How would you use the functions randomize() and random()?<BR>Ans:<BR>Randomize() initiates random number generation with a random value.<BR>Random() generates random number between 0 and n-1;&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>73. What do the functions atoi(), itoa() and gcvt() do?<BR>Ans: atoi() is a macro that converts integer to character.<BR>itoa() It converts an integer to string<BR>gcvt() It converts a floating point number to string&nbsp;<BR><BR>74. How would you use the functions fseek(), freed(), fwrite() and ftell()?<BR>Ans:fseek(f,1,i) Move the pointer for file f a distance 1 byte from location i. fread(s,i1,i2,f) Enter i2 dataitems,each of size i1 bytes,from file f to string s.fwrite(s,i1,i2,f) send i2 data items,each of size i1 bytes from string s to file f.<BR>ftell(f) Return the current pointer position within file f. The data type returned for functions fread,fseek and fwrite is int and ftell is long int.&nbsp;<BR><BR>75. What is the difference between the functions memmove() and memcpy()?<BR>Ans: The arguments of memmove() can overlap in memory. The arguments of memcpy()cannot.&nbsp;<BR><BR>76. What is a file?<BR>Ans: A file is a region of storage in hard disks or in auxiliary storage devices.It contains bytes of information .It is not a data type.&nbsp;<BR><BR>77. IMP&gt;what are the types of file?<BR>Ans: Files are of two types<BR>1-high level files (stream oriented files) :These files are accessed using library functions<BR>2-low level files(system oriented files) :These files are accessed using system calls&nbsp;<BR><BR>78. IMP&gt;what is a stream?<BR>Ans: A stream is a source of data or destination of data that may be associated with a disk or other I/O device. The source stream provides data to a program and it is known as input stream. The destination stream eceives the output from the program and is known as output stream.&nbsp;<BR><BR>79. What is meant by file opening?<BR>Ans: The action of connecting a program to a file is called opening of a file. This requires creating an I/O stream before reading or writing the data.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>80. What is FILE?<BR>Ans: FILE is a predefined data type. It is defined in stdio.h file.&nbsp;<BR><BR>81. What is a file pointer?<BR>Ans: The pointer to a FILE data type is called as a stream pointer or a file pointer. A file pointer points to the block of information of the stream that had just been opened.&nbsp;<BR><BR>82. How is fopen()used ?&nbsp;<BR><BR>83How is a file closed ?<BR>Ans: A file is closed using fclose() function Egfclose(fp); Where fp is a file pointer.&nbsp;<BR><BR>84. What is a random access file?<BR>Ans: File can be accessed at random using fseek() function fseek(fp,position,origin); fp file pointer position number of bytes offset from origin origin 0,1 or 2 denote the beginning ,current position or end of file respectively.&nbsp;<BR><BR>85. What is the purpose of ftell ?<BR>Ans: The function ftell() is used to get the current file represented by the file pointer. ftell(fp); returns a long integer value representing the current file position of the file pointed by the file pointer fp.If an error occurs ,-1 is returned.&nbsp;<BR><BR>86. What is the purpose of rewind() ?<BR>Ans: The function rewind is used to bring the file pointer to the beginning of the file.Rewind(fp);Where fp is a file pointer.Also we can get the same effect byfeek(fp,0,0);&nbsp;<BR><BR>87. Difference between a array name and a pointer variable?<BR>Ans: A pointer variable is a variable where as an array name is a fixed address and is not a variable. A pointer variable must be initialized but an array name cannot be initialized. An array name being&nbsp;<BR>a constant value , ++ and — operators cannot be applied to it.&nbsp;<BR><BR>88. Represent a two-dimensional array using pointer?<BR><BR>89. Difference between an array of pointers and a pointer to an array?<BR>Ans:<BR>Array of pointers&nbsp;<BR>1- Declaration is: data_type *array_name[size];<BR>2-Size represents the row size.<BR>3- The space for columns may be dynamically&nbsp;<BR>Pointers to an array<BR>1-Declaration is data_type ( *array_name)[size];<BR>2-Size represents the column size.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>90. Can we use any name in place of argv and argc as command line arguments ?<BR>Ans: yes we can use any user defined name in place of argc and argv;&nbsp;<BR><BR>91. What are the pointer declarations used in C?<BR>Ans:<BR>1- Array of pointers, e.g , int *a[10]; Array of pointers to integer<BR>2-Pointers to an array,e.g , int (*a)[10]; Pointer to an array of into<BR>3-Function returning a pointer,e.g, float *f( ) ; Function returning a pointer to float<BR>4-Pointer to a pointer ,e.g, int **x; Pointer to apointer to int<BR>5-pointer to a data type ,e.g, char *p; pointer to char<BR><BR>92. Differentiate between a constant pointer and pointer to a constant?<BR>Ans:<BR>const char *p; //pointer to a const character.<BR>char const *p; //pointer to a const character.<BR>char * const p; //const pointer to a char variable.<BR>const char * const p; // const pointer to a const character.<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>93. Is the allocated space within a function automatically deallocated when the function returns?<BR>Ans: No pointer is different from what it points to .Local variables including local pointers variables in a function are deallocated automatically when function returns.,But in case of a local pointer variable ,deallocation means that the pointer is deallocated and not the block of memory allocated to it. Memory dynamically allocated always persists until the allocation is freed or the program terminates.&nbsp;<BR><BR>94. Discuss on pointer arithmetic?<BR>Ans:<BR>1- Assignment of pointers to the same type of pointers.<BR>2- Adding or subtracting a pointer and an integer.<BR>3-subtracting or comparing two pointer.<BR>4-incrementing or decrementing the pointers pointing to the elements of an array. When a pointer to an integer is incremented by one , the address is incremented by two. It is done automatically by the compiler.<BR>5-Assigning the value 0 to the pointer variable and comparing 0 with the pointer. The pointer having address 0 points to nowhere at all.&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#ffffff>http://placement.freshersworld.com/placement-papers/</FONT><BR>95. What is the invalid pointer arithmetic?<BR>Ans:<BR>i) adding ,multiplying and dividing two pointers.<BR>ii) Shifting or masking pointer.<BR>iii) Addition of float or double to pointer.<BR>iv) Assignment of a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type&nbsp;<BR><BR>96. What are the advantages of using array of pointers to string instead of an array of strings?<BR>Ans:<BR>i) Efficient use of memory.<BR>ii) Easier to exchange the strings by moving their pointers while sorting.&nbsp;<BR>97. Are the expressions *ptr ++ and ++ *ptr same?<BR>Ans: No,*ptr ++ increments pointer and not the value pointed by it. Whereas ++ *ptr increments the value being pointed to by ptr.&nbsp;<BR><BR>98.

<P><FONT size=2 face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">3) Datastructure: This was tough part so properly go through linklist stack and queue don't forget&nbsp;to do complexities 1 questions was what we do in post order.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">4) C: This part was also a bit tough because all in all questions output was asked so go throgh questions Exploring in C's question.

Question was like 2-3 algorithms presented there and you have to identify the exact algorithm for eg. Which is the correct algorithm for Inorder traversal tree? You have to pay attention on stack, queue, sorting, complexity etc. There was one question I listened first time- what is the complexity of Cocktail sort?</FONT></P>
