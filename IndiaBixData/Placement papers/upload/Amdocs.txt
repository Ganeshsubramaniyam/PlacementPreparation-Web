First of all there was an online test conducted by MeritTrac company on 12th May and then results were declared on 14th.<BR>The details of Online test -<BR>Sections -<BR>1) Analytical - Quantitative - 20 questions<BR>Learning Ability Logical) - 15 questions<BR>Technical Passage - 10 questions<BR><BR>2) Technical - C/C++/Java - 20 questions<BR>SQL - 15 questions<BR>Unix - 15 questions<BR><BR>4) No negative marking<BR><BR>5) 60% Cutoff in both sections.<BR><BR>Guys analytical section was very easy and requires a day preparation only. Go through RS Agrawal for Quantitative and Logical. Technical Passage was very easy where a passage related 2 computer terminology was given. Most of the questions can be solved directly For rest go through the passage fast. Dont waste time in this.<BR><BR>But technical section was tough.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Choose any language from C/C++/Java and this section will really test your programming skills and concepts. If you are choosing C then go through pointers very well. OOPS concepts must b very clear if you are choosing Java or C++. Then comes the SQL section. Some of the questions were so difficult that even I havn't heard some of them. Practice your queries like subqueries, joins, concepts like views, indexes, database terminologies must be clear.Keep some extra time for this section as there were some questions where some queries were given and you have to find error or select best query. At last there was Unix. Go through some of the basic commands like cat, tee, chmod, grep etc along with their attributes. This section was easy if you are comfortable with allthe basic commands. Go through VI editor and its commands, 3-4 questions from it must b there.<BR>Books -<BR>For sql - Ivan Bayross<BR>For unix - Sumitabha Das&nbsp;<BR><BR>After 2 days i.e on 14th results were declared and out of around 150 students only 12 cleared the apti. So a lot of focus is given 2 apti, so practice hard. Then TI and HR interview was there.<BR><BR><I><B>Check the company profile and they can also ask questions based on that.</B></I><BR>Guys if you clear the apti then be cool because 70% of the battle has been won. The TI of mine was very cool. It went for around 1 hr and he basically asked some of the basics of sql like foreign key, basic query, normalization etc and basic commands of unix. Whatever language you have selected in apti, he will ask questions based on that. So choose carefully. Guys be prepared with ur project what you have done bcoz they focus a lot on ur project. After that my HR interview was a basic one like Tell me about yourself, hobbies, career objective, relocation, working in night shifts, achievements etc.&nbsp;<BR><BR><B><I>Don't take HR lightly.</I></B> Finally only 4 were selected and I was one of them. Guys 1 thing i want to tell u that AMDOCS is really a very good company with a lot of opportunities. They offered us a package of 3.5 pa there is a yearly performance bonus of around 1 lakh. So guys prepare yourself very well and see u in AMDOCS.

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>&nbsp;How to Answer Common interview Questions?</B></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">""An interview is a great opportunity to reflect on your past accomplishments and future goals, Take the time to review what you have done, where you want to go, be honest and to the point. If you engage in conversation in a compelling, relevant and positive way with your prospective employer, you'll give yourself the best chance to land the job you want.""<BR><BR><B>1.Tell me about yourself?</B><BR>This question may be challenging because you need to find a good balance between providing enough information about yourself, without rambling. The key is to keep your answers focused on information relevant&nbsp;<BR>to the position.<BR><BR><B>2.What are your weaknesses?</B><BR>This is one of the questions job seekers fear the most. The best way to answer is by choosing a professional trait and explain how it can be an advantage if well managed. When you identify a weakness, remind the employer you are actively taking actions to correct it. For example, ""I used to have trouble with procrastination, now I have learned to write down a list of things that I need to do, and keep a calendar to keep track of deadlines.""<BR><BR><B>3.What are your long-range career goals?&nbsp;</B><BR>The employer wants to know if you can see yourself working for the company on a long-term basis. Emphasize that you want to secure a position that offers opportunities to grow, develop skills and take on challenges and responsibilities. Do not indicate that you hope to start your own business, change careers or are thinking of going back to school full-time.<BR><BR><B>4.What’s your definition of success?</B><BR>This is a challenging one for many a job hunter because success can be subjective. You might think that success means landing this job and working your way up in the company, but your employer wants to know why you would be successful with the company. What would you be doing on a day to day basis that would lead to success? You might talk about how you maintain a strong work ethic, work with feedback from your boss and peers, and maintain a high level of integrity at all times.<BR><BR><B>5.What motivates you to do a good job?</B><BR>The answer to this one is not money, even if it is. You should be motivated by life's noble pursuits. You want recognition for a job well done. You want to become better at your job. You want to help others or be a leader in your field.<BR><BR><B>6.What's your greatest strength?</B><BR>This is your chance to shine. You're being asked to explain why you are a great employee, so don't hold back and stay do stay positive. You could be someone who thrives under pressure, a great motivator, an amazing problem solver or someone with extraordinary attention to detail. If your greatest strength, however, is to drink anyone under the table or get a top score on Mario Kart, keep it to yourself. The interviewer is looking for work-related strengths.<BR><BR><B>7.Tell me what you know about this company?</B><BR>Do your homework before you go to any interview. Whether it's being the VP of marketing or the mailroom clerk, you should know about the company or business you're going to work for. Has this company been in the news lately? Who are the people in the company you should know about? Do the background work, it will make you stand out as someone who comes prepared, and is genuinely interested in the company and the job.<BR><BR><B>8.Why do you want to work at X Company?</B><BR>This should be directly related to the last question. Any research you've done on the company should have led you to the conclusion that you'd want to work there. After all, you're at the interview, right? Put some thought into this answer before you have your interview, mention your career goals and highlight forward-thinking goals and career plans.<BR><BR><B>9.Why did you leave your previous job, and why are you leaving your current position?&nbsp;</B><BR>Be as honest and specific as possible. Remain positive and focused on the future. Always be respectful of your previous employer. If you currently have a job, focus on what kind of skills you want to develop and how this position fits in with your career plan.<BR><BR><B>10.Where else have you applied?</B><BR>This is a good way to hint that you're in demand, without sounding like you're whoring yourself all over town. So, be honest and mention a few other companies but don't go into detail. The fact that you're seriously looking and keeping your options open is what the interviewer is driving at.<BR><BR><B>11.What are your salary expectations?&nbsp;</B><BR>Try to avoid giving out a precise number at this point. Focus on how important it is for you to learn more about the job. If pressed to answer - give a range of what you understand you are worth in the marketplace.<BR><BR><B>12.Do you have any questions?</B>&nbsp;<BR>This is a great opportunity to show your interest in the company. Ask questions about the company's culture, advancement opportunities and what you can expect from your future colleagues.<BR>Why is this position open?<BR>Can you describe a typical day or week in the position?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

	"<P align=left><FONT size=4>AMDOCS PAPER ON 6TH JULY 2007</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Hi friends, Amdocs came to our campus for placements on july 6th,2007. This year they have changed the pattern. It was only 2 hours exam. They have removed the pseudo code section. Total 7 sections were there – 4 for aptitude and 3 for technical(C/C++/JAVA, sql, unix). They have selected all the candidates who opted for JAVA in the technical section. There were 95 questions in total. There was sectional cut off of 60% for aptitude section. For technical section, there was no sectional cut off. But in total as usual 60% cut off was there. The total paper was objective. 0.25 negative marking was there.&nbsp;<!--?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O /--></P>
<DIV><BR><B>Section –I</B><BR>1.Analytical Ability – 20q<BR>2.Pattern Matching – 15q<BR>3.Comprehension&nbsp; -- 10q</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><B>Section-II</B></DIV>
<DIV>1.C/C++/Java – We can choose one of them&nbsp; -- 20q<BR>2.SQL --&nbsp; 15q</DIV>
<DIV>3.Unix. – 15q</DIV>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify""><B>Analytical Ability</B><BR>I remember only very few questions. First two questions related to sets. In a forest in total 42 animals are there of which 21 have 4 legs n 30 have horns n 5 have both. Then<BR>1. How many animals are there with only 4 legs<BR>2. How many animals are there with only horns<BR>3. There is a die. We can see only three sides of the die at a time. When 3 was on the top 2,4 were on the adjacent sides like that 2 more cases were given and we have to find out&nbsp; the number which is on the opposite side of 2<BR>4. sdfsdf<BR>5. questions 5-10 are alike. Two statements n one question will be there. All of them will be having the same options of<BR>a. The question can be answered with help of only Statement I.<BR>b. With help of only Statement II.<BR>c. We need both the statements to answer the questions<BR>d. We can’t answer the question at all.</P>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"" class=MsoNormal>And I remember <STRONG><EM>some questions among them</EM></STRONG></P>
<DIV><BR>What is the value of sin ½ ? n the statements are</DIV>
<DIV>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sin½cos½=0</DIV>
<DIV>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sin½-cos½=0</DIV>
<DIV>What is the value of n?<BR>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k3-n3=0<BR>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k=0<BR>Is A=1?<BR>a.3A2/5A2=3/5<BR>b.AB=1<BR>…..like that</DIV>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"" class=MsoNormal>Questions 12-16 will be having some number conversions. In general they will give the binary to decimal conversion indirectly. Like for us they have given the following instructions.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In a number system, $ represents 1 and * represents 0. $ when shifted to left , will be multiplied by 2. So 4 is represented as $** .</DIV>
<DIV>And they have given the questions like evaluate the expression like that. And in another paper I saw that they have given the same pattern except that @ represents 1 and # represents 0.&nbsp;</DIV>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify""><B>Pattern Matching</B><BR>In pattern Matching the following options were there for questions 1-3.<BR>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression is same as A&amp;C<BR>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression is same as B&amp;C<BR>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression is same as A&amp;B<BR>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All are same.<BR>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of them are same.</P>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify""><B>Sample question:</B><BR>1. nnMMM@7.34<BR>A. nnMMM@7.34&nbsp; B.nnMMM@734&nbsp; C. nnMMM@7.34</P>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"" class=MsoNormal>Be careful in this section<BR>2. In some system + represents *, - represents +, * represents / and / represents- then evaluate the following expression 6/8-3*6+4<BR>3. Similar kind of question with different system&nbsp;</P>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"" class=MsoNormal>For Questions 6-10 they have given&nbsp; selection criteria of a company and we have to find out whether the given candidate is eligible or not like&nbsp;</P>

<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Hi&nbsp;folks the paper was a mix of toughness, time constraint and easy questions.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">To summarize it, it contained of two main sections:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">1.The Aptitude section</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">2.The Technical section</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">People told me that there is sectional cut off of 60% in each of the two sections:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Now talking about the sub sections of the paper:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">The Aptitude part consisted of 4 subsections.</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>The Technical part also consisted of 4 subsections</STRONG>.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Now ellaborating the paper, first it is a long brain and computer adaptation exercise, of nearly four hours.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>Aptitude Section</STRONG>:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>Ist Section:</STRONG> 18Qs in <STRONG>Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation</STRONG> questions in <STRONG>30 mins</STRONG>.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">This is a easy section u can easily do it, there is enough amount of time.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>IInd Section:</STRONG> 16Qs in <STRONG>Quantitative Ability</STRONG> in <STRONG>25 minutes</STRONG>, again a simple section</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>IIIrd Section:</STRONG> 25 Qs. in <STRONG>20 minutes</STRONG> it is about <STRONG>pattern matching</STRONG>.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>IVth Section:</STRONG> 60 Qs. in <STRONG>6 minutes</STRONG>, there is negative marking, here u get a question which has some text and u have to select the same text among the 4 options.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">speed is tested here in this fourth section, but a person can attempt about 30 to 40 questions depending on his/her speed.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> All the above sections are explained with good examples before u start the test so be cool and patient and read these options with ease and u can crack this section.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><B><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Techincal Section:</FONT></B></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">This section also has four subsections as follows:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>Ist Section</STRONG>: This section is the <STRONG>Amdocs pseudo language</STRONG> section, be cool the name is the only scary part in this section nothing else, remaining is easy with a lot of time, u get <STRONG>60 minutes</STRONG> in this section for 25 questions, but before u start off this section it is advisable to read the booklet that is given along with this section before starting this section, i had forgotten to do this but i believe still managed to get all questions right, it is basically a section of algorithm.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>IInd Section</STRONG>:This section tests u on <STRONG>SQL</STRONG> queries, some are very simple some are tough, u get <STRONG>20 minutes</STRONG> in this section, ample time to solve all questions.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>IIIrd Section:</STRONG>This is a section on <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> language, basically on different types of commands and some theoretical concepts, it also has <STRONG>20 minutes</STRONG>.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>IVth Section:</STRONG> This section is a choice betwee <STRONG>any one</STRONG> of the languages which is your favourite among the four given languages <STRONG>C/C++/Java/Cobol</STRONG>. This is also a section of <STRONG>20 minutes</STRONG>.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman""><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> All the technical subsections have a lot of time for them to be solved easily within the time limit, provided u know them.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">And in case there is only sectional cut offs then it is advisable to try to score the fullest or maximum in the first section(Amdocs pseudo language)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Important:</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Mind u, u can take time off between sub sections of the main sections also so relax in between as well to keep ur efficiency...</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">In all the test is very long, it will take near to 4 hours to complete the full test, only advice is not to rush through the sections quicly as only once u click on the button next will the section start, so take some time off between sections get refreshed and then concentrate with full vigour in the sections.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3 face=""Times New Roman"">Hi,<BR>I attended Amdocs technical test before three months. The test comprises of 5-6 sections and the there is sufficient separate time<BR>for each sections. The test is through there software "" pilate"". I have seen that many of you need the Amdocs papper. I don't remember<BR>any question but i will explain the pattern in detail.<BR><BR>Be cool, the cut off for this is 60% absolute in this test that is easy to achieve,<BR><BR>Different sections:<BR><BR><BR>-&gt;&gt; <STRONG>PROGRAMMING SECTION:time : 1 hour ( sufficient)</STRONG><BR>------------------------------<WBR> ----------------------------<BR><BR>For this you will be given a booklet of 5-10 pages that contains the basics of Amdocs derived language ...very similar to C... Please read<BR>it carefully before start attempting this section ( there is some problem in the software , so the time get started as u click on this section). So please first read it then start the test , even examples.<BR><BR>There are 5-6 main questions.. they are like algorithm.. you have to understand what to be done in the programme and there are 4-5 sub<BR>questions for each main question. The subquestion are of fill in the blanks type, some are for pedicting the output ect.<BR><BR>-&gt;&gt;<STRONG>LANGUAGE TEST : 20 que, 30 minutes</STRONG><BR>------------------------------<WBR> ---------------<BR>In the begening you have to select any programming language like C,C++,Java. I appeared for C and the questions are easy. Time : more<BR>than sufficient.<BR><BR>-&gt;&gt; <STRONG>SQL /DATABASE TEST : 20 que: 30 min</STRONG><BR>------------------------------<WBR> --------------------------<BR>Easy one SQL commands, 1 que on views, 1-2 questions are on basic database.<BR><BR>-&gt;&gt; UNIX : 20 que, 30 minutes<BR>------------------------------<WBR> -------------------<BR>Easy, basic UNIX COMMAND... read yeswant kanitkar book.. starting 5 chepters..<BR><BR>4-5 questins on general things like on protocols,TELNET ect.<BR><BR>-&gt;&gt;<STRONG>PATTERN MATCHING SECTION : 60 questions , 6 minutes.</STRONG><BR>------------------------------<WBR> ---------------------------<BR><BR>This is unique,easy and scoring part. But the time is very very less.. u have to be very fast. Generally one can attempt 20-30 que only.....<BR>But this is very important to score good in this section..<BR><BR>example:<BR><BR>for ( ;x + 5*y &gt;800 ; ++i+++)<BR>&nbsp;is similar to<BR>1.for ( ;x - 5*y &gt;800 ; ++i+++)<BR>2.for ( ;x + 5*y &gt;800 ; ++i++)<BR>3.for ( ;x + 5*y &gt;800 ; ++i+++)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CORRECT<BR>4.for ( ;x + 5*y &gt;80; ++i+++)<BR><BR>See here all the options are looking similar. You don't need to apply any logic, any calculation... just find the same ""pattern"" ... its quite hard to attempt in fraction of seconds. Your main consern in this section should be ACCURACY and TIME.<BR><BR>Perhaps there is NO NEGETIVE marking, so before 1 minutes just mark all ( note that there is separate time for each section, so in 6<BR>minutes, this section will go out)<BR><BR>-&gt;&gt;<STRONG>APPTITUDE TEST 20 que, 30 minutes</STRONG><BR><BR>------------------------------<WBR> ------------------------------<WBR> -----------------<BR>The questions are quite good and need some practice. Time is main concern &nbsp;time and work<BR>age<BR>strems<BR>percentage and ration<BR>profit and loss<BR><BR>-&gt;&gt;<STRONG>NON VERBAL REASONING TEST 20 que, 30 minutes</STRONG><BR><BR>------------------------------<WBR> ------------------------------<WBR> -----------------<BR>Good questions, little tough, time is concern.<BR>Practice some RS Agrawal book.<BR><BR>questions are like...<BR>- complete the sequence.. and 4 pictures are given in and the 5th one is to be chosen through the given options.<BR><BR><BR>-&gt;&gt;<STRONG>VERBAL REASONING TEST 20 que, 30 minutes</STRONG><BR><BR>------------------------------<WBR> ------------------------------<WBR> -----------------<BR>There are basically the questions of data sufficiency and questions based on venn digramms... like<BR><BR>All A are B.<BR>Some B are D.<BR><BR>then which is true<BR>....<BR>.....<BR>------------------------------<WBR> ------------------------------<WBR> --------------<BR>Best of luck.</WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></WBR></FONT></DIV>

<P>First three sections were extremely easy. Try to score max. of these three sections.</P>
<P>Questions on Java were easy but covered vast concepts like OOPS. 1-2 questions were asked each from threading. exceptions, inner classes and collections.</P>
<P>SQL was bit difficult. You must know about views thoroughly. Just an overview might not be enough.</P>
<P>I didnt know anything about</P>
<P>UNIX. But other candidates were saying that it was easy only.</P>
<P>If you score more than 65 % overall you will get through.</P>
<P>In all there were 95 questions which have to be done in 120 minutes..</P>
<P>If you know techica; well (or do not know what to do in a particular section :)) time well be enough..</P>
<P>From about 600 students that gave the exam 49 were selected for the interviews. Luckily I was one of them. We recieved the call for interviews on 13 October and interviews were held on 16 October in their Office at Gurgaon...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Technical Interview panel was very cool.. They try to make you fully comfortable.</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Q. Tell me about yourself</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. In different ways overloading can be implemented.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. Can main function be used more than once in java</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. How many catch blocks can be put after try block</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. What should be the order of preference for that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. Memory management in java</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. Use of finalize function</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. What project did you made in curriculum</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. Why did you choose that?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. Innovative ideas that you putin that?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. Then a littlle code about project.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q. What are the DDL, DCL, DQL, DML querries</P>

<P>The interview went for about 45 minutes. If you give 70% questions right you will be through. Results were announced about 4 hours later.. 15 students were selected for the HR round..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>HR round</P>
<P>Q. Tell me about yourself</P>
<P>Q. Strengths nd weaknesses. Why?</P>
<P>Q. Achievements in life</P>
<P>Q. Why amdocs?</P>
<P>HR was like formality only. Around 12 students were finally selected.. With God's grace I was one of them We were given offer letters on the same evening.<BR><BR>My suggestion will be to try to help each other out during process. Process of Amdocs is such that your competition is with you only. Not others..&nbsp;</P>

Amdocs selection procedure was simple Amdocs First section was Aptitude and technical on line test and Technical and Hr interview. For detailed informations and selection procedure details refer below candidates experiences&nbsp;</B><BR><BR><BR>Hi All,<BR>Amdocs visited our campus on 14th May . First of all there was an online test conducted by MeritTrac company on 12th May and then results were declared on 14th.<BR>The details of Online test -<BR>Sections -<BR>1) Analytical - Quantitative - 20 questions<BR>Learning Ability Logical) - 15 questions<BR>Technical Passage - 10 questions<BR><BR>2) Technical - C/C++/Java - 20 questions<BR>SQL - 15 questions<BR>Unix - 15 questions<BR><BR>4) No negative marking<BR><BR>5) 60% Cutoff in both sections.<BR><BR>Guys analytical section was very easy and requires a day preparation only. Go through RS Agrawal for Quantitative and Logical. Technical Passage was very easy where a passage related 2 computer terminology was given. Most of the questions can be solved directly For rest go through the passage fast. Dont waste time in this.<BR><BR>But technical section was tough.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Choose any language from C/C++/Java and this section will really test your programming skills and concepts. If you are choosing C then go through pointers very well. OOPS concepts must b very clear if you are choosing Java or C++. Then comes the SQL section. Some of the questions were so difficult that even I havn't heard some of them. Practice your queries like subqueries, joins, concepts like views, indexes, database terminologies must be clear.Keep some extra time for this section as there were some questions where some queries were given and you have to find error or select best query. At last there was Unix. Go through some of the basic commands like cat, tee, chmod, grep etc along with their attributes. This section was easy if you are comfortable with allthe basic commands. Go through VI editor and its commands, 3-4 questions from it must b there.<BR>Books -<BR>For sql - Ivan Bayross<BR>For unix - Sumitabha Das&nbsp;<BR><BR>After 2 days i.e on 14th results were declared and out of around 150 students only 12 cleared the apti. So a lot of focus is given 2 apti, so practice hard. Then TI and HR interview was there.<BR><BR><I><B>Check the company profile and they can also ask questions based on that.</B></I><BR>Guys if you clear the apti then be cool because 70% of the battle has been won. The TI of mine was very cool. It went for around 1 hr and he basically asked some of the basics of sql like foreign key, basic query, normalization etc and basic commands of unix. Whatever language you have selected in apti, he will ask questions based on that. So choose carefully. Guys be prepared with ur project what you have done bcoz they focus a lot on ur project. After that my HR interview was a basic one like Tell me about yourself, hobbies, career objective, relocation, working in night shifts, achievements etc.&nbsp;<BR><BR><B><I>Don't take HR lightly.</I></B> Finally only 4 were selected and I was one of them. Guys 1 thing i want to tell u that AMDOCS is really a very good company with a lot of opportunities. They offered us a package of 3.5 pa there is a yearly performance bonus of around 1 lakh. So guys prepare yourself very well and see u in AMDOCS.

<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px""><B>&nbsp;How to Answer Common interview Questions?</B></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: verdana,geneva,sans-serif""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12px"">""An interview is a great opportunity to reflect on your past accomplishments and future goals, Take the time to review what you have done, where you want to go, be honest and to the point. If you engage in conversation in a compelling, relevant and positive way with your prospective employer, you'll give yourself the best chance to land the job you want.""<BR><BR><B>1.Tell me about yourself?</B><BR>This question may be challenging because you need to find a good balance between providing enough information about yourself, without rambling. The key is to keep your answers focused on information relevant&nbsp;<BR>to the position.<BR><BR><B>2.What are your weaknesses?</B><BR>This is one of the questions job seekers fear the most. The best way to answer is by choosing a professional trait and explain how it can be an advantage if well managed. When you identify a weakness, remind the employer you are actively taking actions to correct it. For example, ""I used to have trouble with procrastination, now I have learned to write down a list of things that I need to do, and keep a calendar to keep track of deadlines.""<BR><BR><B>3.What are your long-range career goals?&nbsp;</B><BR>The employer wants to know if you can see yourself working for the company on a long-term basis. Emphasize that you want to secure a position that offers opportunities to grow, develop skills and take on challenges and responsibilities. Do not indicate that you hope to start your own business, change careers or are thinking of going back to school full-time.<BR><BR><B>4.What’s your definition of success?</B><BR>This is a challenging one for many a job hunter because success can be subjective. You might think that success means landing this job and working your way up in the company, but your employer wants to know why you would be successful with the company. What would you be doing on a day to day basis that would lead to success? You might talk about how you maintain a strong work ethic, work with feedback from your boss and peers, and maintain a high level of integrity at all times.<BR><BR><B>5.What motivates you to do a good job?</B><BR>The answer to this one is not money, even if it is. You should be motivated by life's noble pursuits. You want recognition for a job well done. You want to become better at your job. You want to help others or be a leader in your field.<BR><BR><B>6.What's your greatest strength?</B><BR>This is your chance to shine. You're being asked to explain why you are a great employee, so don't hold back and stay do stay positive. You could be someone who thrives under pressure, a great motivator, an amazing problem solver or someone with extraordinary attention to detail. If your greatest strength, however, is to drink anyone under the table or get a top score on Mario Kart, keep it to yourself. The interviewer is looking for work-related strengths.<BR><BR><B>7.Tell me what you know about this company?</B><BR>Do your homework before you go to any interview. Whether it's being the VP of marketing or the mailroom clerk, you should know about the company or business you're going to work for. Has this company been in the news lately? Who are the people in the company you should know about? Do the background work, it will make you stand out as someone who comes prepared, and is genuinely interested in the company and the job.<BR><BR><B>8.Why do you want to work at X Company?</B><BR>This should be directly related to the last question. Any research you've done on the company should have led you to the conclusion that you'd want to work there. After all, you're at the interview, right? Put some thought into this answer before you have your interview, mention your career goals and highlight forward-thinking goals and career plans.<BR><BR><B>9.Why did you leave your previous job, and why are you leaving your current position?&nbsp;</B><BR>Be as honest and specific as possible. Remain positive and focused on the future. Always be respectful of your previous employer. If you currently have a job, focus on what kind of skills you want to develop and how this position fits in with your career plan.<BR><BR><B>10.Where else have you applied?</B><BR>This is a good way to hint that you're in demand, without sounding like you're whoring yourself all over town. So, be honest and mention a few other companies but don't go into detail. The fact that you're seriously looking and keeping your options open is what the interviewer is driving at.<BR><BR><B>11.What are your salary expectations?&nbsp;</B><BR>Try to avoid giving out a precise number at this point. Focus on how important it is for you to learn more about the job. If pressed to answer - give a range of what you understand you are worth in the marketplace.<BR><BR><B>12.Do you have any questions?</B>&nbsp;<BR>This is a great opportunity to show your interest in the company. Ask questions about the company's culture, advancement opportunities and what you can expect from your future colleagues.<BR>Why is this position open?<BR>Can you describe a typical day or week in the position?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

	"<P align=left><FONT size=4>AMDOCS PAPER ON 6TH JULY 2007</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Hi friends, Amdocs came to our campus for placements on july 6th,2007. This year they have changed the pattern. It was only 2 hours exam. They have removed the pseudo code section. Total 7 sections were there – 4 for aptitude and 3 for technical(C/C++/JAVA, sql, unix). They have selected all the candidates who opted for JAVA in the technical section. There were 95 questions in total. There was sectional cut off of 60% for aptitude section. For technical section, there was no sectional cut off. But in total as usual 60% cut off was there. The total paper was objective. 0.25 negative marking was there.&nbsp;<!--?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O /--></P>
<DIV><BR><B>Section –I</B><BR>1.Analytical Ability – 20q<BR>2.Pattern Matching – 15q<BR>3.Comprehension&nbsp; -- 10q</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><B>Section-II</B></DIV>
<DIV>1.C/C++/Java – We can choose one of them&nbsp; -- 20q<BR>2.SQL --&nbsp; 15q</DIV>
<DIV>3.Unix. – 15q</DIV>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify""><B>Analytical Ability</B><BR>I remember only very few questions. First two questions related to sets. In a forest in total 42 animals are there of which 21 have 4 legs n 30 have horns n 5 have both. Then<BR>1. How many animals are there with only 4 legs<BR>2. How many animals are there with only horns<BR>3. There is a die. We can see only three sides of the die at a time. When 3 was on the top 2,4 were on the adjacent sides like that 2 more cases were given and we have to find out&nbsp; the number which is on the opposite side of 2<BR>4. sdfsdf<BR>5. questions 5-10 are alike. Two statements n one question will be there. All of them will be having the same options of<BR>a. The question can be answered with help of only Statement I.<BR>b. With help of only Statement II.<BR>c. We need both the statements to answer the questions<BR>d. We can’t answer the question at all.</P>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"" class=MsoNormal>And I remember <STRONG><EM>some questions among them</EM></STRONG></P>
<DIV><BR>What is the value of sin ½ ? n the statements are</DIV>
<DIV>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sin½cos½=0</DIV>
<DIV>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sin½-cos½=0</DIV>
<DIV>What is the value of n?<BR>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k3-n3=0<BR>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k=0<BR>Is A=1?<BR>a.3A2/5A2=3/5<BR>b.AB=1<BR>…..like that</DIV>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"" class=MsoNormal>Questions 12-16 will be having some number conversions. In general they will give the binary to decimal conversion indirectly. Like for us they have given the following instructions.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In a number system, $ represents 1 and * represents 0. $ when shifted to left , will be multiplied by 2. So 4 is represented as $** .</DIV>
<DIV>And they have given the questions like evaluate the expression like that. And in another paper I saw that they have given the same pattern except that @ represents 1 and # represents 0.&nbsp;</DIV>
<P style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify""><B>Pattern Matching</B><BR>In pattern Matching the following options were there for questions 1-3.<BR>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression is same as A&amp;C<BR>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression is same as B&amp;C<BR>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression is same as A&amp;B<BR>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All are same.<BR>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of them are same.</P>
