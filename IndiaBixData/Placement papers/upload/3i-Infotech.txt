<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>One day work = 1 / 20<BR>One mans one day work = 1 / ( 20 * 75)<BR>Now:<BR>No. Of workers = 50<BR>One day work = 50 * 1 / ( 20 * 75)<BR>The total no. of days required to complete the work = (75 * 20) / 50 = 30</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer:5.3 %<BR>Explanation:<BR>He sells 950 grams of pulses and gains 50 grams.If he sells 100 grams of pulses then he will gain (50 / 950) *100 = 5.26</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer:250 lines of codes</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer: 7 days<BR>Explanation:<BR>The equation portraying the given problem is:<BR>10 * x  2 * (30  x) = 216<BR>where x is the number of working days.Solving this we get x = 23<BR>Number of days he was absent was 7 (30-23) days.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer: 150 men<BR>Explanation:<BR>One days work = 2 / (7 * 90)<BR>One hours work = 2 / (7 * 90 * 8)<BR>One mans work = 2 / (7 * 90 * 8 * 75)<BR>The remaining work (5/7) has to be completed within 60 days, because the total number of days allotted for the project is 150 days.<BR>So we get the equation<BR>(2 * 10 * x * 60) / (7 * 90 * 8 * 75) = 5/7 where x is the number of men working after the 90th day.<BR>We get x = 225. Since we have 75 men already, it is enough to add only 150 men<BR>.<BR>Answer: (c) 1<BR>Explanation:<BR>a percent of b : (a/100) * b<BR>b percent of a : (b/100) * a<BR>a percent of b divided by b percent of a : ((a / 100 )*b) / (b/100) * a )) = 1<BR>Answer: Cost price of horse = Rs. 400 &amp; the cost price of cart = 200.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Explanation:-<BR>Let x be the cost price of the horse and y be the cost price of the cart.<BR>In the first sale there is no loss or profit. (i.e.) The loss obtained is equal to the gain.<BR>Therefore (10/100) * x = (20/100) * y<BR>X = 2 * y -----------------(1)<BR>In the second sale, he lost Rs. 10. (i.e.) The loss is greater than the profit by Rs. 10.<BR>Therefore (5 / 100) * x = (5 / 100) * y + 10 -------(2)<BR>Substituting (1) in (2) we get<BR>(10 / 100) * y = (5 / 100) * y + 10<BR>(5 / 100) * y = 10<BR>y = 200<BR>From (1) 2 * 200 = x = 400<BR>Answer : 3.<BR>Explanation:<BR>Since inclusion of any male player will reject a female from the team. Since there should be four member in the team and only three males are available, the girl, n should included in the team always irrespective of others selection.<BR>Answer:5<BR>Answer: 1,2,3 &amp; 4<BR>Answer: B<BR>Answer:11 &amp; 9 apples per tree.<BR>Explanation:<BR>Let a, b, c, d &amp; e be the total number of apples bored per year in A, B, C, D &amp; E s orchard. Given that a + 1 = b + 3 = c  1 = d + 3 = e  6<BR>But the question is to find the number of apples bored per tree in C and D s orchard. If is enough to consider c  1 = d + 3.<BR>Since the number of trees in Cs orchard is 11 and that of Ds orchard is 13. Let x and y be the number of apples bored per tree in C &amp; d s orchard respectively.<BR>Therefore 11 x  1 = 13 y + 3<BR>By trial and error method, we get the value for x and y as 11 and 9<BR>Answer: G.<BR>Explanation:<BR>The order in which they are climbing is R  G  K  H  J -18</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Explanation:<BR>Since Blueja doesnt publish the novel by Burchfield and Heron publishes the novel spy thriller, Piegon publishes the novel by Burchfield.Since Hopper writes Gothic romance and Heron publishes the novel spy thriller, Blueja publishes the novel by Hopper.Since Heron publishes the novel spy thriller and Heron publishes the novel by Gorky, Gorky writes Spy thriller and Rathko writes Murder mystery.</FONT></P>

One need to have good grip on percentages, Time speed and distance, averages, Work and allegations, calculations, little bit of numbers and most importantly DI (data Interpretation).you get around 3 sets of DI (15 questions) and all are based on pure calculations and observations.please go through all the line graphs, bar graphs, pie charts and all sort of graphs.5 questions were directly on calculations which was the most easiest part of the section..forgot to tell about the Data Sufficiency (there were around 8 questions)-----difficulty level was very easy..remember to spend only 30 min for each section<BR>There are sectional cutoffs<BR>.<BR><B>3) Reasoning</B><BR>This section is all about the observation. Please take as many practice test as possible from R.S Agarwal..this is the lengthiest section (but never mindeverybody has to go with the same kind of questions)..and also remember one thing we shall not try to attempt all the questions (if u do, it will be a big blunder)..make sure answer them with care and get it correct the moment you attempt that.

<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>One day work = 1 / 20<BR>One mans one day work = 1 / ( 20 * 75)<BR>Now:<BR>No. Of workers = 50<BR>One day work = 50 * 1 / ( 20 * 75)<BR>The total no. of days required to complete the work = (75 * 20) / 50 = 30</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer: 0<BR>Explanation:<BR>Since 3x / 2 = x / (2 / 3)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer:5.3 %<BR>Explanation:<BR>He sells 950 grams of pulses and gains 50 grams.If he sells 100 grams of pulses then he will gain (50 / 950) *100 = 5.26</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer:250 lines of codes</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer: 7 days<BR>Explanation:<BR>The equation portraying the given problem is:<BR>10 * x  2 * (30  x) = 216<BR>where x is the number of working days.Solving this we get x = 23<BR>Number of days he was absent was 7 (30-23) days.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Answer: 150 men<BR>Explanation:<BR>One days work = 2 / (7 * 90)<BR>One hours work = 2 / (7 * 90 * 8)<BR>One mans work = 2 / (7 * 90 * 8 * 75)<BR>The remaining work (5/7) has to be completed within 60 days, because the total number of days allotted for the project is 150 days.<BR>So we get the equation<BR>(2 * 10 * x * 60) / (7 * 90 * 8 * 75) = 5/7 where x is the number of men working after the 90th day.<BR>We get x = 225. Since we have 75 men already, it is enough to add only 150 men<BR>.<BR>Answer: (c) 1<BR>Explanation:<BR>a percent of b : (a/100) * b<BR>b percent of a : (b/100) * a<BR>a percent of b divided by b percent of a : ((a / 100 )*b) / (b/100) * a )) = 1<BR>Answer: Cost price of horse = Rs. 400 &amp; the cost price of cart = 200.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Explanation:-<BR>Let x be the cost price of the horse and y be the cost price of the cart.<BR>In the first sale there is no loss or profit. (i.e.) The loss obtained is equal to the gain.<BR>Therefore (10/100) * x = (20/100) * y<BR>X = 2 * y -----------------(1)<BR>In the second sale, he lost Rs. 10. (i.e.) The loss is greater than the profit by Rs. 10.<BR>Therefore (5 / 100) * x = (5 / 100) * y + 10 -------(2)<BR>Substituting (1) in (2) we get<BR>(10 / 100) * y = (5 / 100) * y + 10<BR>(5 / 100) * y = 10<BR>y = 200<BR>From (1) 2 * 200 = x = 400<BR>Answer : 3.<BR>Explanation:<BR>Since inclusion of any male player will reject a female from the team.

Given that a + 1 = b + 3 = c  1 = d + 3 = e  6<BR>But the question is to find the number of apples bored per tree in C and D s orchard. If is enough to consider c  1 = d + 3.<BR>Since the number of trees in Cs orchard is 11 and that of Ds orchard is 13. Let x and y be the number of apples bored per tree in C &amp; d s orchard respectively.<BR>Therefore 11 x  1 = 13 y + 3<BR>By trial and error method, we get the value for x and y as 11 and 9<BR>Answer: G.<BR>Explanation:<BR>The order in which they are climbing is R  G  K  H  J -18</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Explanation:<BR>Since Blueja doesnt publish the novel by Burchfield and Heron publishes the novel spy thriller, Piegon publishes the novel by Burchfield.Since Hopper writes Gothic romance and Heron publishes the novel spy thriller, Blueja publishes the novel by Hopper.Since Heron publishes the novel spy thriller and Heron publishes the novel by Gorky, Gorky writes Spy thriller and Rathko writes Murder mystery.</FONT></P>
