Adobe procedure consists of written round, technical and hr round</B><BR><BR>Adobe Written Round has 4 sections : 2 aptitude and 2 engineering section aptitude and reasoning section was not difficult it was easy questions. Engineering section was very difficult to crack<BR><BR>The two engineering sections consisted of questions of Data Structures, Algorithms and C outputs.<BR><BR>Some questions that were in the engineering section were<BR><BR>1)Given some numbers like 20,10,5,7,30. Make AVL tree and BST of this. The example involved rotations also.<BR><BR>2)Lowest common ancestor of a BST<BR><BR>3)Reversing a single linked list and double linked list.<BR><BR>4)C output<BR><BR>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;<BR><BR>void crazy(int a,int b, int m, int n)<BR><BR>{<BR><BR>if(n==0)<BR><BR>return;<BR><BR>crazy(a+m,b,m+b,n-1);<BR><BR>printf(""%d %d %d %dn"",a,b,m,n);<BR><BR>crazy(a,b+m,m+a,n-1);<BR><BR>}<BR><BR>int main()<BR><BR>{<BR><BR>crazy(2,5,1,3);<BR><BR>return(0);<BR><BR>}<BR><BR>5)C outputs on pointer like<BR><BR>a) int arr[10][20][30] ,base address of a was given , then value of *(*arr+1)+2<BR><BR>b) extern int *a; //File 1<BR><BR>int a[10] //File 2<BR><BR>What happens when both files are compiled<BR><BR>6) GCD of two numbers. They wanted Euclied Algorithm<BR><BR>7) Maximum of three numbers using ternary operator<BR><BR>8) A C output on expansion of Macro. That expansion was to be done very carefully ,otherwise you may get wrong answer<BR><BR>9)Middle of linked list in one traversal<BR><BR>10) evaluation of a prefix expression<BR><BR>11)Question based on hashing. A hash function was given and some numbers were given we have to hash those numbers according to hash function.<BR><BR>12)Assembly language output<BR><BR>13)Pointers to functions<BR><BR>Adobe Technical Round 1<BR><BR>The first round started with c++ outputs. In Adobe they ask a lot of c++ outputs in interview. The outputs were<BR><BR>1)int fun(int &amp;x) and we call this function with<BR><BR>a)fun(a) a was int<BR><BR>b)fun(a) a was long long int<BR><BR>c)fun(a) a was char<BR><BR>In which cases we will get error ?<BR><BR>2) Calling a destructor by object of class . Suppose you have some class X. You create object of that class X a; then call a.~X(); how many times destructor will be called .<BR><BR>3) C++ outputs on virtual functions (About 3 to 5 were asked). Those questions involved virtual pointer table, virtual destructors , size of class in case of virtual functions etc.<BR><BR>4) After that interviewer started asking Java outputs. “super.super.super” is allowed in java or not . Then he asked me about interfaces and abstract class.<BR><BR>5) Then some general questions. What is a cross compiler? What is Unicode ? Why it was needed? UTF-8, UTF-16 , ASCII ? Difference between them.<BR><BR>6) Loop in a linked list. He asked me whether I have done this question or not. I replied yes. So he asked me to make a working code of the question.<BR><BR>7) Full booting procedure<BR><BR>8) Questions on virtual memory. Why it was needed?<BR><BR>9) Longest common substring between two strings. Two solutions by dynamic programming and by trie were given by me.<BR><BR>10) Then some outputs on C pointers. That involved function pointers, and single and double pointer.<BR><BR>11) Some general questions again. Why I want to join Adobe? Whether I will pursue higher studies while working in Adobe?<BR><BR>Adobe Technical Round 2<BR><BR>1) Merge two sorted linked list without using extra memory.<BR><BR>2) There are m machines. each machine generates coins of 10 g.only one machine is defective which generates coins of 9 g.how to find that defective machine in one weighing only. Now there are two defective machines. how do you find them in one weighing. The problem was finally converted to k defective machines,<BR><BR>3) Producer Consumer semaphore code using semwait and semsignal<BR><BR>4) Questions on OS about semaphore and deadlock.<BR><BR>5) Allocate two dimensional matrix using new.<BR><BR>Adobe Technical Round 3<BR><BR>1)Write a c program to select a contiguous subarray of size m from an array such that its sum is closest to zero.<BR><BR>2)Second largest element in a given array<BR><BR>3) Implement queue using two stacks<BR><BR>4) You are given two hour glasses(those glasses are filled with sand). One hour glass gets emptied by 4 minutes another by 7 minutes. Find how will you calculate 9 minutes. Same puzzle was asked to me in GoldMan Sach. All the companies they repeat even the puzzles also :P<BR><BR>5) A question on dynamic programming.<BR><BR>6)Size of structure.

He commented that my lowest grade - B- was in Digital Image Processing. I just looked at him like a doofus thinking of what to say. But he quickly added, 'don't worry, it happens.' So people, be fully prepared to explain any anomalous grades. I was prepared with the explanation of the W in the my grade-sheet but not of the B- in DIP.

What is the exact number of comparisons required in the worst case? Note that they didn't ask the order in Big-Oh notation. They wanted the exact number of comparisons.<BR><BR><SPAN style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Answer :</SPAN> I screwed up, big time in this question. I had superficially discussed this question with my friend a while ago and he had outlined an algorithm which I thought that I had understood, but I hadn't. I started off explaining it but got stuck in the middle. He sternly told me to read it up again. One solution that I could tell him, and which I had written in the test was this:<BR><BR>Use two variables - min and second min. Initialize them by comparing the first two elements of the array. This is (1) comparison. Then, go through the entire array, from index 2 to n-1 comparing each element, first with min and then with second min, updating each variable as necessary. This will involve a worst case of two comparisons for each element. Therefore, total number of comparisons = 2*(n-2) + 1 = 2*n - 3 comparisons.<BR><BR>I'll try to update this with a better solution, sometime soon.</SPAN></SPAN><BR>&nbsp;</LI>

You shoot a ray parallel to the x-axis passing through this point. Start with odd parity. Change parity of ray each time it intersects an edge of the polygon (consider special case of when the line passes through a vertex of the polygon. Change parity only if it passes through a vertex which has one edge above it and one edge below the ray). If the parity of ray is even when it passes through the point, it is inside the polygon, else it is not.</SPAN></SPAN><BR>&nbsp;</LI>

I gave some answer, but he was clearly not satisfied. I thought it was all over by then.<BR><BR>Then, he asked me a DIP question. He commented that he had given that particular question to his juniors in IITB once and they had done a very good job at it. The problem is this:<BR><BR>A teacher is writing on a blackboard and we want to pass all the information on the blackboard over a low-bandwidth network in real-time. How do we do it.<BR><BR><SPAN style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Answer :</SPAN> I first suggested that we capture only a small portion of the board. To locate that portion, we could search for the chalk in the prof's hand - of course, taking care that it had the blackboard in the background (no point capturing a video of the prof scratching his chin, na?). Further, if the prof was writing only text, we could convert the video into text by OCR and then transmitting. Simple diagrams could also be reduced to a set of vector-graphics instructions (we rarely, see the prof shading stuff). I think he liked my approach, but was not completely satisfied. Anyway, we left it at that and went forward.</SPAN></SPAN><BR>&nbsp;</LI>

Store every word as a path from the root to a leaf with pointers in the correct places. For example, hello would be stored as - pointer from 'h' index of the root array to a node which had a pointer from 'e' index of it's array to a node which had a pointer from 'l' index of the array.. and so on.

I was able to answer all his questions, but I made the mistake of telling him, when we started off that I didn't know much about this subject as I had done it a long time ago.
